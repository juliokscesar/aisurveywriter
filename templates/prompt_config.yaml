  **Please provide your output in LaTeX format, using the following guidelines for structure and content:**

  # LaTeX Sectioning:

  - Use numbered sectioning commands (\section, \subsection, etc.).
  - DO NOT use unnumbered commands (e.g., \section*, \subsection*).
  - Exclude the LaTeX preamble (e.g., \documentclass, \usepackage).
  
  # Figures and Tables:

  - Use the TikZ package to include any figures that you think are relevant.
  - Refer to figures and tables in the text using proper citations, such as (Fig. X, AUTHOR, YEAR) or (Tab. X, AUTHOR, YEAR), where X is the number of the figure/table.
  
  # Citations and References:

  - Use the biblatex package for all references and citations.
  - Cite references in the text using the \cite{nickname} command.
  - Provide a bibliography section at the end of your response enclosed within the following environment:
  ```
  \begin{filecontents*}{mybib.bib}
  (REFERENCES IN BIBLATEX FORMAT)
  \end{filecontents*}
  ```

  - Assign reference nicknames in the format author_year (e.g., smith_2024).
  - Include citations for all works explicitly referenced in the section and for works cited indirectly through other authors.
  - There's no need to include the field 'abstract' in biblatex format.
  - Don't use '\printbibliography' anywhere
