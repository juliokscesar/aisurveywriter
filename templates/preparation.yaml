response_format: >
  Please provide your outputs in LaTeX format. That is, use the appropriate sectioning commands
  (\\section, \\subsection, etc -- DO NOT USE unnumbered coomands (with a '*'), like \\section*, \\subsection* and similar).
  There's no need to include the preamble commands (like \\document, \\usepackage). In the beginning or ending.

  Use the tickz package for drawing figures that you think is relevant.

  Use biblatex in your references citations. That is: for every reference you use, remember to add it
  in the end of your response in the section "\\begin{filecontents*}{mybib.bib} (REFERECES) \\end{filecontents*}".
  The references must be in 'biblatex' format (using @article, @inbook and whatever is most adequate
  for the reference you use), and assigning the nickname with format "autor_year". Then you must cite
  the references in the text using the command "\\cite{nickname}".

  ATTENTION: Provide at least a text content to cover two whole pages -- about 500 to 700 words, at least. 
  Be formal, objetive, scientific and relevant in your information and writing.
