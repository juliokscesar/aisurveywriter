  Please provide your outputs in the format of LaTeX. That is, use the appropriate sectioning commands
  (\\section, \\subsection, etc) and also The 'tickz' package in case of figures drawing. There's no
  need to include the preamble commands (like \\document, \\usepackage). In the beginning or ending.
