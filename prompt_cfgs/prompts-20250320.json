So make sure your sections cover the fundamentals of the entire content thoroughly.\n\n3. **OUTPUT FORMAT**:\n- Provide the structure in JSON format. THE TILE MUST BE ENCLOSED WITH QUOTES\n- Do it as follows:\n    ```json\n    {{\n        \"sections\": [\n        {{ \n            \"title\": \"Section1 Title\",\n            \"description\": \"- Subsection Title\\n\\t- Explanation of what this subsection will cover.\\n\\t- Additional details as necessary.\\n- Another Subsection Title\\n\\t- Explanation.\\n\\t- More details.\"\n        }},\n        {{\n            \"title\": \"Section2 title\",\n            \"descripton\": \"- Subsection title\\n- More explanation...\"\n        }}\n        ]\n    }}\n    ``` \n\n**Provide your answer in English only**.",

DO NOT write long texts in tables\n        - Table captions must appear ABOVE the table\n    - For visual explanations, use TikZ (without \\includegraphics).\n        - Figure captions must appear BELOW the figure\n- Writing Style:\n    - Write in English with a formal, scientific, and objective tone.\n    - At least 500 words per section\u2014the more detailed, the better.\n    - Avoid numbered/unnumbererd lists and redundancy; write fluid, structured text.\n\n**Task**:\n- You are an expert academic writer in {subject}, creating a comprehensive survey based on provided references.\n- Incorporate direct insights from these works and their cited sources, but do not copy.
