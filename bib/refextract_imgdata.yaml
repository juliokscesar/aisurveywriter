- description: The image illustrates an artificial signal transduction system on a
    lipid bilayer vesicle. Section (A) shows a receptor molecule that, in its "OFF
    State," binds to an effector (LDH with Cu2+). A chemical signal triggers a change,
    releasing the LDH, which then catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate + NADH to lactate
    + NAD+ ("ON State"). Section (B) demonstrates an azobenzene-type receptor. UV
    light converts it to a form that cannot bind Cu2+, activating the enzyme. Visible
    light reverses the process, returning the system to the "OFF State." The lipid
    bilayer acts as a platform for these molecular interactions.

- description: 'Here''s a concise description of the image:


    The image illustrates a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution mechanism. Light excites
    electrons (e-) from the valence band (VB) of a carbon nitride structure to its
    conduction band (CB). These electrons then transfer to the LUMO of a porphyrin
    molecule, with holes (h+) quenched by lactic acid. Electrons travel via bridged
    species (EDTA/PAA) to palladium (Pd) sites, where they reduce protons (H+) to
    form hydrogen gas (H2). The diagram shows energy levels in eV.'

- description: The image illustrates the formation of a monolayer at the air-water
    interface using a betulin methacrylate-containing polymer. The polymer structure
    is shown with a green oval highlighting the betulin moiety and a blue oval indicating
    the methoxyoligo(ethylene glycol)methacrylate fragment. Initially, the polymer
    exists as a micelle in chloroform (CHCl3). As the chloroform evaporates at the
    air-water interface, the polymer self-organizes, with the betulin portion exposed
    to the air and the methoxyoligo(ethylene glycol)methacrylate portion immersed
    in the water, forming a stable monolayer.

    -A isotherms for Bet-1 (a, b) and Bet-2 (c, d) monolayers at varying compression\
    \ rates (10 mm/min and 5 mm/min). The x-axis represents the molecular area (A,\
    \ nm\xB2/molecule), while the y-axis shows the surface pressure (\u03C0, mN/m).\
    \ Each graph contains multiple curves, numbered 1 to 4, likely representing different\
    \ spreading volumes. Inset plots show the relationship between maximum surface\
    \ pressure (\u03C0) and spreading volume (V, \xB5L). The curves illustrate how\
    \ surface pressure changes with molecular area under different conditions."

    \ a positive correlation between height and time."

- description: 'The image illustrates the formation of mixed monolayers at the air-water
    interface. It contrasts two scenarios: one using cholesterol (Chol) and the other
    using dihexadecyl phosphate (DHP). Each scenario begins with a monolayer of either
    Chol or DHP, with their respective polar headgroups (OH or P) oriented towards
    the water. Polymer micelles are then introduced via syringe, spreading between
    the lipid molecules. This results in a mixed monolayer of polymer and either Chol
    or DHP, with the polymer chains interacting with both the lipid molecules and
    the water subphase.'
