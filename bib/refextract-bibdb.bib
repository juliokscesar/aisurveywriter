 Comprehensive expressions have been presented to facilitate the analysis of the surface sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectrum. The electric field components of the SFG beam for a given experimental setup have been related via appropriately defined Fresnel coefficients to the nonlinear source polarization, which in turn has been related to the electric fields of exciting visible and infrared beams through the macroscopic SFG susceptibility tensor. The coefficients of transformation have been given to relate the laboratory-fixed Cartesian components of the SFG tensor to the components described in a surface-fixed axis system. The tensor components have been further related to the components of the microscopic hyperpolarizability tensor of surface species, and the explicit expressions (in terms of the Euler angles defining molecular orientation) of the transformation coefficients are presented to describe the Cartesian tensor components described in a surface-fixed axis system by the molecule-fixed components.  },

 abstract = {
 This study devoted to the FT-IR spectroscopy of monolayers spread at the air\/water interface is, to our knowledge, the first report presenting complete mid-infrared monolayer spectra perfectly extracted from the strong water vapor bands. This has been possible with the use of the polarization-modulated IRRAS method, which is not sensitive to the isotropic absorptions of the sample environment. On the basis of theoretical modeling and experiments, the best angle of incidence has been found near 76\u00b0 for detection of intraplane as well as out-of-plane oriented monolayer absorptions. With the use of such experimental conditions, on the normalized difference (covered vs. uncovered water) PM-IRRAS spectra, monolayer vibrational bands come out upward or downward, depending on the orientation of their transition moment with respect to the interface. Application to the study of deuterated arachidic acid and arachidate monolayers allows observation of the vibrational modes of the polar head groups interacting with the liquid water molecules and provides some evidence of their symmetrical anchoring. The vibrational modes of the liquid water subphase contribute to these difference spectra as broad dips that certainly contain information on a possible restructuring of the water molecules at the interface.  },

 abstract = { \n         Introduction \n        
The need for rose aromatic compounds is very high globally, where the beta-ionone compound as a precursor for rose aroma can be produced through the oxidation process of carotenoids, especially beta carotene. Therefore, Beta-ionone is the compound responsible for the rose fragrance, which is needed industrially. Carotenoids are easily degraded by various factors, namely heat, oxygen, light and enzymatic. This research has carried out heat degradation of carotene compounds extracted from orange sweet potato to determine the effect of heating time on forming aromatic compounds such as Beta-ionone and dihydroactinidiolide (dhA). \n       \n       \n         Methodology \n        
Thermal degradation of carotene was carried out at 140\u00b0C for 1, 2, 3, and 4 h. The constant oxygen concentration of 7 l.h-1 was used to induce the oxidation. The spectrophotometric analysis of total carotene and the gas chromatographic-mass spectrometry analysis of volatile compounds were conducted to clarify the efficiency of the carotene degradation process and aromatic compounds' formation, respectively. \n       \n       \n         Results \n        
Orange sweet potatoes contain 1.2% of carotenoids on a dry weight basis. Beta-ionone and dihydroactinidiolide compounds increased along with decreased total carotene value during heating. The results showed that heating sweet potato carotene at 140\u00b0C for 4 h caused carotene degradation of up to 93%. Therefore, the optimum thermal degradation treatment for the formation of \u03b2-ionone and dhA compounds was the heating condition at a temperature of 140\u00b0C for 4 h. \n       \n       \n         Conclusion \n        
This research has shown the potential of sweet potatoes as a non-aromatic raw material that can be used to produce aromatic compounds. The use of the crude extract in this research means that the beta-ionone content in the product after oxidation is still low due to the presence of other components; this needs to be a concern for further research. \n       },

Successful LiNbO 3  film was prepared with the variation of 0%, 2%, 4%, and 6% RuO 2  concentration and annealing temperature variation above the p-type silicon substrate (100), using the CSD method with the spin coating at 8000 rpm for 30 seconds in solubility 2 M. Films in annealing at 850 \u00b0C for 8 hours with a temperature increase of 1.67 C\/min. Samples were characterised using SEM and EDX spectrometer. We have obtained the morphology nonhomogenous surface and element stoichiometry. LiNbO 3  thin film is a potential material for light sensors. },

 We have already reported that raw nori (Porphyra tenera) contains cobalamin (Cbl) but not Cbl analogues (J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol., 42, 497, 1996). It seems, therefore, that it is an excellent natural vegetable source of Cbl. On the other hand, it has been reported that the Cbl nutritional status of vegetarian children deteriorated as estimated by the hematological index, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), after they had dried nori as a source of Cbl. Such a discrepancy between raw and dried nori as a source of Cbl led us to investigate whether Cbl in dried nori had different properties from that in raw nori. We found that contents of Cbl homologues determined by a bioassay method in both raw and dried nori were similar. The urinary methylmalonic acid excretion increased when human female volunteers were given 40 g of dried nori daily during the test period. On the other hand, the urinary methylmalonic acid excretion did not change when volunteers were daily given 320 g of raw nori, which was equivalent to 40 g of the dried one on the basis of dehydrated weight, during the test period. By paper chromatography, 65% of the Cbl homologues were found to be comprised of Cbl analogues in dried nori, while 73% of the Cbl homologues in the raw nori were genuine Cbl. These results were confirmed by the finding that the bioassay method gave higher values for Cbl homologues than those obtained by a competitive binding assay method using an intrinsic factor as a Cbl-binding protein. Our present data demonstrated that Cbl in raw nori can be changed into harmful Cbl analogues by the drying process.  },

 Conjugates ofanionic polyelectrolytes (PE) with betulin (PE\u2013B) were synthesized by cross-linking the carboxyl groups oftemperature responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (CP1) and poly(N-vinylpyrrolidoneco-acrylic acid) (CP2) copolymers, to the hydroxyl groups ofbetulin using thionyl chloride as the coupling agent. Water-insoluble CP1\u2013B and poorly soluble CP2\u2013B covalent conjugates were formed in a single step by mixing solutions of the selected components. Water-soluble bovine serum albumin (BSA)\u2013betulin covalent conjugates (BSA*B) were synthesized by carbodiimide coupling. Betulin-containing polyelectrolyte conjugates (PEC\u2013B) were prepared by complexing BSA*B conjugates with synthetic polycations \u2013 poly(N-alkyl-4-vinylpyridinium bromide). A single immunization ofmice with CP1\u2013B and CP2\u2013B, covalent conjugated with protein containing PEC\u2013B and BSA*B systems without traditional adjuvants increased the specific immune response to betulin. CP2\u2013B, as a soft and wet biocompatible delivery system, in contrast to the CP1\u2013B conjugates, displayed an essentially higher betulin-specific immunogenic activity. The immunogenicity of BSA*B conjugates decreased rapidly with time while the PE\u2013BSA*B complexes generated betulin-specific antibodies for 160 days.  },

A highly ordered monolayer film of alkanethiol-encapsulated gold nanoparticles was fabricated on a silicon substrate by using the Langmuir\u2013Blodgett (LB) method. The effects on the particle order, of the particle concentration and the type of solvent of the LB spreading suspension of encapsulated gold particles, were studied. We found that a low particle concentration of 0.06\u20130.3 mg\/mL in chloroform is optimal for the fabrication of high quality gold particle monolayers. Since the proposed method is not restricted to gold particles, it is believed to be a practical process for fabricating quantum dot structures of various particle sizes and compositions. },

A substantial lowering of the work function of a tungsten Langmuir probe immersed in an argon plasma in a discharge tube is observed. The mechanism is thought to be similar to the Schottky effect. The electron temperature measurement is lowered about 30%, in a particular discharge condition, as the probe goes from room temperature to 2000\u00b0C. The charge number density measurement, by saturation electron current appears to be higher by 15%, and that by ion saturation current appears to be higher by almost one order of magnitude. This phenomenon can also account for the discrepancy of the ratio of ion and electron saturation current obtained by previous authors and this author. },

The formulas previously published for the average (square) length and radius of long-chain molecules with restricted internal rotation are applied to a somewhat idealized model of the normal paraffin hydrocarbons. The potential barrier for rotation about the carbon-carbon single bond has been compounded of the usual threefold component plus a smaller onefold component which serves to stabilize the trans configuration of three successive bonds. Calculations are presented for a wide range of values of the parameters, and the most probable values of the parameters applicable to the normal paraffins, as determined from the thermodynamic and spectroscopic data, are discussed. The predicted ratios of the values of the average length and radius to the values calculated for free rotation are 1.76, 1.48, 1.36, and 1.29 at 0\u00b0, 100\u00b0, 200\u00b0, and 300\u00b0C, respectively. The effect of steric hindrance is discussed, and it is pointed out that the calculated values are probably appreciably low because of the neglect of steric hindrance. },

The gaseous, liquid, mesomorphous and solid states in monolayers are defined and their close connection with the corresponding states in three dimensions rigorously established. This involves a new treatment of the two-dimensional liquid and of its transformation to the mesomorphous state. The properties of the three-dimensional vitreous state of fatty substances are shown to be particularly important in connection with the behavior of monolayers. The different critical and transformation temperatures are also defined and their significance explained. From this is derived a systematic classification of the different types of isotherms observed. By determining the variations of the compressibility, viscosity and apparent dipole moment with change of area, higher order transformations are detected in monolayers. These transformations occur at the same areas as those at which ordinary phase transformations occur at lower temperatures. },

The thermodynamic relations of insoluble monolayers on a mobile subphase are given, and equations are presented for their (a) increase of entropy, (b) heat absorbed, (c) increase of heat content, and (d) increase of internal energy, during expansion. Two different methods of expansion are considered: in spreading the decrease of area of the subphase is equal to the increase of area of the monolayer; in extension the monolayer expands but the area of the clean surface of the subphase remains constant. The two-dimensional phases are classified as: I. gas; II. liquid (L1) expanded; III. intermediate or transition; IV. liquid (L2) condensed; and V. solid. The extreme limits of molecular area for the intermediate liquid phase are for pentadecylic acid about 22 and 44A2, while those for the liquid phases IV, III, and II, are from about 20.5 to 52A2 which indicates that, beginning with a two-dimensional liquid in its most condensed condition, the mean molecular distances may be increased by as much as 60 percent without a destruction of the liquid state. This is very different from what is found in three dimensions. The heat absorbed in the melting of the two-dimensional solid is zero, so this is phase change of the second order. The quantity, hs = (\u2202Hs\/\u2202\u03c3)p,T, which is the increase in heat content when the monolayer spreads over unit area, has a value of several hundred ergs cm\u20142 for a solid film. The increase of heat content for the other two-dimensional phases may be illustrated by the approximate values for pentadecylic acid: it is zero for (L2), or the liquid condensed phase; rises in the intermediate phase very gradually to a nearly constant magnitude of 300 ergs cm\u20142 as the area is increased and decreases to about 50 erg cm\u20142 in the liquid expanded phase (L1). For any two-dimensional phase spread on water or on mercury the value of h for extension is greater than that for spreading by he the total surface energy of the three-dimensional liquid, which is about 116 erg cm\u20142 for water, and 540 for mercury. The increase of heat content \u0394Hm during the spreading of a mole of pentadecylic acid has been calculated for the case in which the film spreads from the lowest to the highest area at which the phase exists. For the solid phase this energy is of the order of about a fifth of a kcal. mole\u20141 at 18\u00b0C, while \u0394Hm for the intermediate phase is 8.3 kcal. mole\u20141, and for the liquid expanded (L2) phase is very small. At 25\u00b0C the value for the intermediate phase has fallen to 4.6, and that for the liquid expanded phase (L2) has increased to 1.0 kcal. mole\u20141. },

The electronic structure of a vapor-sublimated thin film of metal-free phthalocyanine (H2Pc) is studied experimentally and theoretically. An atom-specific picture of the occupied and unoccupied electronic states is obtained using x-ray-absorption spectroscopy (XAS), core- and valence-level x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. The DFT calculations allow for an identification of the contributions from individual nitrogen atoms to the experimental N1s XAS and valence XPS spectra. This comprehensive study of metal-free phthalocyanine is relevant for the application of such molecules in molecular electronics and provides a solid foundation for identifying modifications in the electronic structure induced by various substituent groups. },

Redshift of the methanol symmetric stretch mode, gradual disappearance of the water dangling-OH mode, and blueshifts of the dangling and liquidlike bonded-OH modes were also observed as the methanol concentration increased.

Spin transport through molecules is investigated using self-assembled monolayers of oleic acid molecules on half metallic Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements indicate that 1 ML (monolayer) molecules chemically bond to the Fe3O4 nanoparticles and the physically absorbed molecules do not exist in the samples. The magnetoresistance (MR) of cold-pressed, molecule fully covered nanoparticles is up to 7.3% at room temperature and 17.5% at 115 K under a field of 5.8 kOe. The MR ratio is more than two times larger than that of pure Fe3O4 nanoparticles. This enhanced MR is likely arising from weak spin scattering while carriers hop through the oleic acid molecules. These results show that small molecules are promising for development of future spin-based molecular electronics. },

The electronic properties of Cu-phthalocyanine (CuPc) molecules flat lying along the channels of the Au(110) reconstructed surface have been investigated by means of ultraviolet and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The ordered chains give rise to a highly ordered single-layer structure with a (5\u00d73) symmetry. Although from the core-level analysis not any significant charge transfer between the molecules and the underlying Au surface is observed, the valence band photoemission data bring to light CuPc-induced features localized at the interface. In particular, energy versus momentum dispersion of an interface state reveals a bandwidth of about 90 meV along the enlarged Au channels, where the CuPc chains are formed, with a defined fivefold symmetry well fitting the CuPc intermolecular distance. },

We present a study of excitation energies in solution at the equation of motion coupled cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) level of theory. The solvent effect is introduced with a state specific polarizable continuum model (PCM), where the solute-solvent interaction is specific for the state of interest. Three definitions of the excited state one-particle density matrix (1PDM) are tested in order to gain information for the development of an integrated EOM-CCSD\/PCM method. The calculations show the accuracy of this approach for the computation of such property in solution. Solvent shifts between nonpolar and polar solvents are in good agreement with experiment for the test cases. The completely unrelaxed 1PDM is shown to be a balanced choice between computational effort and accuracy for vertical excitation energies, whereas the response of the ground state CCSD amplitudes and of the molecular orbitals is important for other properties, as for instance the dipole moment. },

It has been shown by Tago, Nishimura, and Yanagisawa [IEEE Trans. Magn. MAG-21, 2032 (1985)] that addition of small amounts of Re to CoZr produces material with zero magnetostriction. We have prepared CoZr and CoZrRe amorphous films by rf sputtering, producing alloys with soft magnetic characteristics suitable for use in thin-film recording heads. The dependence of coercivity, anisotropy field, and saturation magnetization on sputtering conditions and film composition has been characterized. Co93Zr7 films have been fabricated with 4\u03c0Ms of 15 kG and Hc less than 0.4 Oe in the as-sputtered state. Similar results were obtained with Co92Zr6Re2 films. The films which exhibited the best soft magnetic properties were deposited at low target bias, 5-mTorr argon pressure, and zero substrate bias. Below 1500-V target bias, low anisotropy field was accompanied by a dispersion factor of up to 4\u00b0 in CoZr and up to 9.5\u00b0 in CoZrRe films. Coercivity and anisotropy field both increased with increasing target bias, whereas film dispersion decreased. These effects were accompanied by a decrease in Zr content in both CoZr and CoZrRe films of up to 5 at.\u2009% across the range of target biases. It is believed that, at bias greater than 2500 V, substrate heating was also significant in determining film characteristics. Increasing argon pressure increased the coercivity and anisotropy field, which is in agreement with previously published results for CoZr. Applying bias to the substrate also increased the coercivity and anisotropy field, producing films with undesirable magnetic properties. Trends and limitations of the deposition technique are analyzed and discussed. },

Pending full numerical simulations, the stripe width behavior versus Co and Pt thicknesses has been confronted to the predictions of a purely magnetostatic model.

Langmuir\u2013Blodgett multilayered (6\u201312) films of a semifluorinated fatty acid, F(CF2)8(CH2)10COOH, have been deposited on transmission and reflection substrates and investigated using polarized infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The spectra revealed that the cadmium salt of this fatty acid was transferred and not the acid itself. Unlike its hydrocarbon analog, [F(CF2)8(CH2)10COO\u2212]2 Cd2+ is not oriented normal to the surface but is inclined due to the packing constraints dictated by the considerably larger cross section of the fluorocarbon part of the molecule. At elevated temperatures, the orientation of the fluorocarbon chain is observed to change and this has been attributed to disordered conformations preferentially introduced in the hydrocarbon portion of the molecule due to its inherent flexibility relative to the rigid fluorocarbon helix. },

Real surfaces are rough and chemically heterogeneous on many length scales and wetting phenomena on these surfaces are affected by this inhomogeneous nature. We have used x-ray reflectivity to examine the structure of static precursing films which precede the macroscopic meniscus of water on glass. We have examined the thickness of the film, the roughness of the interfaces bounding the film, and the conformality or correlations between the roughness features of these bounding interfaces. The wetting film consists of three basic components: the bulk meniscus, a thin (\u2264100 \u00c5) precursing wetting film which has a sudden termination, and beyond that, a much thinner film characteristic of the glass surface in contact with water vapor only. The roughness and chemical heterogeneity of the solid manifest themselves in the roughness of the water\/vapor interface of the film, in the irregularity of the terminating boundary of the precursor wetting film, and in the hysteretic pinning of that boundary. The roughness of the glass surface is observed to impose additional roughness to the water\/vapor interface beyond that which would exist on a bulk interface. These results are discussed in terms of the disjoining pressure which governs the behavior of such films. },

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed on Langmuir monolayers of single chain surfactants at the air\u2013water interface using a new anisotropic united atom model (AUA) for chain\u2013chain interactions and a dipolar potential for head\u2013head repulsions. Water\u2013surfactant interactions are modeled using an external potential that does not fix the head group positions. The forces of the skeletal chains involved intramolecular effects of angle bending, and rotation among quartets of adjacent segments. Several molecular dynamics simulations have been performed on monolayers with densities ranging from 18 to 30 \u00c52\/molecule. The results show two transitions in the monolayer. The first phase transition is a melting from a triangular lattice state maintained by the carbon chains to a fluidlike state with chain diffusion and lattice defects. The second transition is characterized by a change in molecular conformation, but with no change in lattice defects. },

Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) multilayer systems are found to be inhomogeneous in morphology and structure. The most characteristic feature of these multilayer films is the appearance of three-dimensional domains in which the molecules arrange themselves as a result of the film transfer onto the substrate. A series of lead arachidate (PbA2) LB multilayers have been prepared as model systems to study the dependence of film morphology on the pH value in the subphase. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and two different x-ray scattering methods [specular (XSR) and diffuse (XDS) x-ray reflectometry] have been used to investigate the intrinsic interface properties, such as the vertical electron density profile and lateral distribution of head groups and chains, as well as the microscopic description of the interface structure, thus providing an overall picture of the investigated multilayers. With AFM, discrete height variations of domains with minimum step widths of one double layer independent of the salt concentration in the films were observed. The lateral domain size shows a dependence on pH. It was found to be maximum at pH=4.2 (pure acid) but minimum at pH 7.0 (maximum salt content). The AFM pictures were treated by a statistical analysis to extract quantities that can be compared with the x-ray results. A considerable number of Bragg maxima were observed in XSR. The vertical correlation length LZ was calculated from the angular width of Bragg maxima along 2\u03b8 and was found to vary with pH value. It follows, in general, the tendency of the domain sizes, being maximum at pH=4.8 and minimum at pH=7.0, respectively. The lateral correlation length LX has been evaluated via XDS from the half widths \u0394\u03c9 measured by rocking the sample across a fixed 2\u03b8. It decreases for increasing pH. LX was compared with the respective quantity of the AFM analysis. Estimated by XDS, the correlation lengths for inner interfaces and domains complement one another with the lateral length scales resulting from AFM analysis of the surface. },

Molecular dynamics simulations of n-hexane adsorbed onto the interface of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([bmim][Tf2N]) are performed at three n-hexane surface densities, ranged from 0.7 to 2.3 \u03bcmol\/m2 at 300 K. For [bmim][Tf2N] room-temperature ionic liquid, we use a non-polarizable all-atom force field with the partial atomic charges based on ab initio calculations for the isolated ion pair. The net charges of the ions are \u00b10.89e, which mimics the anion to cation charge transfer and polarization effects. The OPLS-AA force field is employed for modeling of n-hexane. The surface tension is computed using the mechanical route and its value decreases with increase of the n-hexane surface density. The [bmim][Tf2N]\/n-hexane interface is analyzed using the intrinsic method, and the structural and dynamic properties of the interfacial, sub-interfacial, and central layers are computed. We determine the surface roughness, global and intrinsic density profiles, and orientation ordering of the molecules to describe the structure of the interface. We further compute the survival probability, normal and lateral self-diffusion coefficients, and re-orientation correlation functions to elucidate the effects of n-hexane on dynamics of the cations and anions in the layers. },

Iron-phthalocyanine and cobalt-phthalocyanine chains, assembled along the Au(110)-(1\u00d72) reconstructed channels, present a strong interaction with the Au metallic states, via the central metal ion. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy from the metal-2p core-levels and valence band high-resolution ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy bring to light signatures of the interaction of the metal-phthalocyanine single-layer with gold. The charge transfer from Au to the molecule causes the emerging of a metal-2p core level component at lower binding energy with respect to that measured in the molecular thin films, while the core-levels associated to the organic macrocycle (C and N 1s) are less influenced by the adsorption, and the macrocycles stabilize the interaction, inducing a strong interface dipole. Temperature Programmed Desorption experiments and photoemission as a function of temperature allow to estimate the adsorption energy for the thin-films, mainly due to the molecule-molecule van der Waals interaction, while the FePc and CoPc single-layers remain adsorbed on the Au surface up to at least 820 K. },

Survey scans include peaks coming from the stainless steel substrate, such as Fe and Cr. An x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum, Sm 3d, C 1s, and O 1s narrow scans are shown. It was determined, using XPS, that the heating process decomposed the deposited Sm acetate to Sm2O3. },

Magnesium alloys have been widely used as a new medical metal implant material because of their good physicochemical properties, biodegradability and biocompatibility. But magnesium alloys are very chemically active and easily corroded after being implanted in the human body. In this paper, a hydroxyapatite\/fatty acid salt superhydrophobic composite film was prepared on the surface of magnesium alloys by hydrothermal method. By testing, the water contact angle of the prepared composite film layer reaches 154.5\u00b0, and the corrosion current density is reduced by two orders of magnitude, which effectively improves the corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys. The hydrophobic properties of the prepared superhydrophobic composite membrane show good chemical stability. This preparation method can have good application prospects in industry and medical materials because of its simplicity and efficiency. },

Lithium\u2013sulfur (Li\u2013S) batteries have garnered immense interest due to their potential to surpass the energy densities of state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries. However, severe technical problems of polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effect still prohibit the commercialization of Li\u2013S batteries. This review focuses on the recent advances of polysulfide mediation in conventional Li\u2013S batteries with liquid electrolytes. Simple yet effective solutions to control polysulfide dissolution and shuttling via facile modification of the cathode and the electrolyte are highlighted. The rational design of cathode composition, the use of polysulfide barrier layers, and the selection of electrolyte components are discussed. These strategies offer significant promise to address the challenges and increase the viability of the large-scale application of Li\u2013S batteries. },

Convective deposition has become one of the common techniques for obtaining a colloidal assembly with a desired number of layers\/thickness. Many applications in photonics and semiconductor industries demand only a single layer of colloids placed in a reproducible manner. In the convective deposition, a deposition velocity is typically inversely correlated with a number of layers. Obtaining a uniform monolayer reproducibly thus requires maintaining precise conditions such as the pH, volume fraction, ionic strength of the suspension, temperature, and humidity. Maintaining ideal conditions is one of the limiting factors for the scale-up of convective deposition. Likewise, the surface chemistry must also be reproducible. In the following study, we have demonstrated the effect of the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant on convective deposition. We show that added SDS alters the flow patterns inside the thin film through Marangoni-driven surface stress, which then alters the time for the assembly. The added surfactant can permit more reliable conditions for monolayer coatings. This study using controlled amounts of the surfactant may give a broader understanding of variability of results found in the literature. },

The acoustic characteristics of 2D single\u2010oscillator, dual\u2010oscillator, and triple\u2010oscillator acoustic metamaterials were investigated based on concentric ring structures using the finite element method. For the single\u2010oscillator, dual\u2010oscillator, and triple\u2010oscillator models investigated here, the dipolar resonances of the scatterer always induce negative effective mass density, preventing waves from propagating in the structure, thus forming the band gap. As the number of oscillators increases, relative movements between the oscillators generate coupling effect; this increases the number of dipolar resonance modes, causes negative effective mass density in more frequency ranges, and increases the number of band gaps. It can be seen that the number of oscillators in the cell is closely related to the number of band gaps due to the coupling effect, when the filling rate is of a certain value. },

 abstract = { Abstract \n               
Hypoxia is a hallmark of solid tumors. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are the main transcriptional factor that regulate the cellular response to hypoxic stress. HIFs are heterodimers consisting of an oxygen-sensitive alpha subunit (HIF\u03b1) and a constitutively active beta subunit (HIF1\u03b2, also called aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, ARNT). Among the three homologous HIF\u03b1 genes, HIF1\u03b1, HIF2\u03b1, and HIF3\u03b1, the functions of HIF1\u03b1 and HIF2\u03b1 are best characterized. HIF1\u03b1 is ubiquitously expressed in essentially all tissue types, while HIF2\u03b1 expression is more tissue specific. Under normoxia, HIF\u03b1 is hydoxylated by prolyl-4-hydroxylases (PHDs), targeting it for proteasome destruction mediated by the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Under hypoxic conditions, the activity of PHDs decreases and HIF\u03b1 is stabilized and forms a dimer with HIF1\u03b2. The HIF\u03b1\/HIF1\u03b2 dimer is then translocated into the nucleus and binds specifically to the promoters of a large number of target genes involved in adaptation and protection against low oxygen conditions. It is well known that HIF\u03b1 is stabilized by acute hypoxia and its level decreases under prolonged hypoxic conditions. However, the mechanism remains unknown. Now, we have identified an antisense RNA that regulates the interaction between HIF\u03b1 and VHL. The induction of the anitsense RNA is responsible for the regulation of HIF\u03b1 stability under prolonged hypoxia. Our study revealed a novel mechanism regulating HIF\u03b1 pathway. \n

The October Revolution and the sequence of events triggered by this coup drove crowds of Russians to foreign lands. On arrival in a new environment, many cultured and highly educated people forged contacts and began to establish various organisations and associations. The primary purpose of these associations was to bring together Russian citizens who had found themselves in a new homeland, to provide them with social support, and to foster their national identity. At the same time the activities of many \u00e9migr\u00e9 organisations, with their highly skilled and highly educated membership, significantly contributed to the development of disciplines and activities of various local institutions.\nThe purpose of this text is to present the contribution of Russian emigrants to Yugoslav scholarship. The focus is on various scholarly institutions and associations, which emerged between the arrival of the first large group of Russian emigrants in 1921 and the year 1945, when the activity of the \u00e9migr\u00e9 organisations died down. },

The stellar mass-to-light ratio ( M \n                   * \/ L ) of galaxies in a given wave band shows tight correlations with optical colors, which have been widely applied as cheap estimators of galaxy stellar masses. These estimators are usually calibrated using either broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) or spectroscopy at galactic centers. However, it is unclear whether the same estimators provide unbiased  M \n                   * \/ L  for different regions within a galaxy. In this work we employ integral field spectroscopy from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey. We also examine the correlations of spatially resolved  M \n                   * \/ L  obtained from full spectral fitting, with different color indices, as well as galaxy morphology types, distances to the galactic center, and stellar population parameters such as stellar age and metallicity. We find that the ( g  \u2212  r ) color is better than any other color indices, and it provides almost unbiased  M \n                   * \/ L  for all the SDSS five bands and for all types of galaxies or regions, with only slight biases depending on stellar age and metallicity. Our analysis indicates that combining multiple colors and\/or including other properties to reduce the systematics and scatters of the estimator does not work better than a single color index defined by two bands. Therefore, we have obtained a best estimator with the ( g  \u2212  r ) color and applied it to the MaNGA galaxies. Both the two-dimensional map and radial profile of  M \n                   * \/ L  are reproduced well in most cases. Our estimator may be applied to obtain surface mass density maps for large samples of galaxies from imaging surveys at both low and high redshifts. },

 abstract = { Abstract \n          
The aim of this review paper is to summarize recent developments in the field of wearable sensors and systems that are relevant to the field of rehabilitation. The growing body of work focused on the application of wearable technology to monitor older adults and subjects with chronic conditions in the home and community settings justifies the emphasis of this review paper on summarizing clinical applications of wearable technology currently undergoing assessment rather than describing the development of new wearable sensors and systems. A short description of key enabling technologies (i.e. sensor technology, communication technology, and data analysis techniques) that have allowed researchers to implement wearable systems is followed by a detailed description of major areas of application of wearable technology. Applications described in this review paper include those that focus on health and wellness, safety, home rehabilitation, assessment of treatment efficacy, and early detection of disorders. The integration of wearable and ambient sensors is discussed in the context of achieving home monitoring of older adults and subjects with chronic conditions. Future work required to advance the field toward clinical deployment of wearable sensors and systems is discussed. },

Currents induced in Earth by temporal variations in the external magnetic field have long been used to probe mantle electrical conductivity, but almost exclusively from sparsely distributed land observatories. Satellite\u2010borne magnetometers, such as flown on Magsat, \u00d8rsted, and Champ, offer the prospect of improved spatial coverage. The approach we have taken is to isolate induction by harmonic Dst (\u201cdisturbance storm time\u201d) excitation of the magnetospheric ring current in satellite magnetic measurements: this is done by removing the magnetic contributions of the main (core) magnetic field, the crustal magnetic field, and ionospheric fields (cause of the daily variation) using  Sabaka et al. 's [2000, 2002]CMP3 comprehensive model. The Dst signal is then clearly evident in the midlatitude satellite passes lower than 50 degrees geomagnetic latitude. At higher latitudes, auroral and field aligned currents contaminate the data. We fit the internal and external components of the Dst signal for each equatorial pass, exploiting the fact that the geometry for the internal and external components is different for the azimuthal and radial vector components. The resulting timeseries of internal and external field variations shows that the Dst signals for the dawn passes are half those of the dusk passes. The sum of equatorial external and internal components of the field averaged over dawn and dusk passes provides an excellent estimate for the Dst index, and may in fact be superior when used as a proxy for the purposes of removing induced and magnetospheric fields from satellite magnetic data. We call this estimate satellite Dst. Cross spectral analysis of the internal and external timeseries shows both greater power and higher coherence in the dusk data. We processed the transfer function between internal and external dusk timeseries to provide globally\u2010averaged, frequency dependent impedances that agree well with independently derived estimates. We estimate Earth's radial electrical conductivity structure from these impedances using standard regularized inversion techniques. A near\u2010surface conductor is required, of thickness less than 10 km with a conductivity\u2010thickness product almost exactly that of an average Earth ocean. Inversions suggest that an increase in conductivity at 440 km depth, predicted by recent laboratory measurements on high pressure phases of olivine, is not favored by the data, although, as in previous studies, the 670 km discontinuity between the upper and lower mantle is associated with a two orders of magnitude jump in conductivity. A new feature in our inversions is a further increase in lower mantle conductivity at a depth of 1300 km. A global map of the internal (induced) component of the magnetic field provides a qualitative estimate of three\u2010dimensional (3\u2010D) variations in Earth electrical conductivity, demonstrating graphically that the satellite data are responsive to lateral variations in electrical conductivity caused by the continents and oceans. },

@article{835397,
 abstract = {
Surface pressure area isotherms of Langmuir monolayers formed by spreading mixed solutions of varying concentrations of  N -octadecyl- N \u2032-phenylthiourea (OPT) and octadecanoic acid or stearic acid (SA) over air-water interface are described. Examination of the hysteresis behavior and an analysis of the limiting area per molecule of the isotherms show that when the spread solution has an excess of OPT, the limiting surface area is consistent with a monolayer composed of equimolar amounts of the two components. This indicates that any excess thiourea, which on its own does not form a stable monolayer, is squeezed out and is not part of the monolayer. On the other hand, when the spreading mixture has an excess of SA over OPT, the isotherm indicates that the entire originally spread material is incorporated into the surface film. In this case, the values of area\/molecule indicate that the monolayer is composed of SA\u2009:\u2009OPT complex with a ratio of 1\u2009:\u20091 together with the excess SA remaining in the monolayer. },

 abstract = { This chapter talks about interest in the liquid-liquid interface that is concerned with the topic of emulsions, which is closely related to the study of food science. It explains that the liquid-liquid interface consists of liquid drops dispersed in another liquid, which are normally thermodynamically unstable and are usually stabilized by the adsorption of an emulsifier. It also considers the movement of a solute from one liquid phase to another. This is important with processes such as liquid-liquid extraction in the chemical industry and in many biological situations. The chapter highlights the role of membranes that can be significant in solute transport and is an essential feature of many biological processes. It reviews emulsions that are concerned with water or an aqueous solution as one phase and a water-insoluble organic liquid as the other phase. },

 abstract = { This chapter begins with a discussion on extended \u03c0 bonds and the concept of conjugation. It stresses that the C=C double bond is made up of a \u03c3 bond and a \u03c0 bond, and the characteristic chemical properties of ethene come mainly from the \u03c0 bond. The chapter also highlights that two C=C double bonds separated by a single \u03c3 bond are also able to interact by sideways overlap of their \u03c0 molecular orbitals or MOs (called a conjugative interaction) in a conjugated system. The chapter then introduces stabilization or delocalization energy. It investigates how constituent \u03c0 and p orbitals of appropriate energy and symmetry within a molecule (or ion) interact to give the new MOs of a conjugated system, and how the conjugation can be described by resonance. Next, the chapter considers the electronic structure of benzene and the nature of aromaticity. },

@book{9781849732529,
 abstract = {
Chemical nomenclature has attracted attention since the beginning of chemistry, when the need to exchange knowledge was first recognised. The responsibility for providing nomenclature to the chemical community was assigned to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, whose Rules for Inorganic Nomenclature were published and revised in 1958 and 1970. Since then many new compounds have appeared, particularly with regard to coordination chemistry and boron chemistry, which were difficult to name using the 1970 Rules. Consequently, the IUPAC Commission on the Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry decided to thoroughly revise the last edition of the 'Red Book'. As many of the new fields of chemistry are very highly specialised and require complex nomenclature, the revised edition is in two parts. Whilst Part I is mainly concerned with general inorganic chemistry, this volume, Part II, addresses such diverse chemistry as polyanions, isotopic modification, tetrapyrroles, nitrogen hydrides, inorganic ring, chain, polymer, and graphite intercalation compounds. The recommendations bring order to the nomenclature of these specialised systems, based on the fundamental nomenclature described in Part I and the organic nomenclature publications. Each chapter has been subject to extensive review by members of IUPAC and practising chemists in various areas. },

Gastritis cystica profunda (GCP) is a rare disease that is often observed at the stoma site of patients undergoing\n      gastric surgery. Specific symptoms are often lacking, making it difficult to diagnose. GCP may\n      develop into cancer. Endoscopic resection is a good method to reduce surgical injury, and the\n      therapeutic effect depends on the status of the primary disease. 
The patient was a 77-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital for repeated\n      epigastric distention. The man had never undergone gastric surgery and did not have Helicobacter pylori infection. Physical and laboratory tests showed no\n      abnormality. Computed tomography showed no significant abnormality. Endoscopy revealed\n      multiple ulcers on the posterior wall of the gastric body, but biopsy showed no evidence of\n      malignancy. The patient subsequently underwent ESD surgery with a lesion of 1.5 cm\u00d72.3 cm.\n      Pathological results showed the cystic dilatation of gastric glands in the submucosa, with\n      some well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. The final diagnosis was GCP with well-differentiated\n      gastric adenocarcinoma. 
Herein, we describe a case of ESD therapy for GCP with well-differentiated gastric\n      adenocarcinoma. When gastric mucosal lesions are difficult to diagnose, further treatment and\n      diagnosis with EMR or ESD can be considered. For patients with early gastric cancer, long-term\n      postoperative monitoring should be carried out. },

The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed during the cycling of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) by decomposition of electrolyte molecules has key impact on device performance. However, the detailed decomposition process and distribution of products remain a mystery due to the wide variety of electrochemical pathways and the lack of facile analytical methods for chemical characterization of SEIs. In this report, a gradient polarity solvent wash technique involving the use of solvents with gradually increased polarities is employed to sequentially remove different SEI components from electrode surfaces. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is utilized to characterize the SEI composition. The impacts of electrolyte additives and discharge rates over SEI formation are illustrated. This study presents a new concept of rationally controlled solvent wash technique for electrode surface analysis that can selectively remove targeted components. The findings in this study provide experimental support for the slow charge formation processes commonly employed for LIBs in industry. },

We demonstrate that the addition of CO 2  to a standard 1.0 M LiPF 6  3:7 wt% ethylene carbonate:ethyl methyl carbonate electrolyte results in the formation of a thinner insoluble solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that is dominated by the presence of LiF. In contrast, cells without CO 2  result in a thicker insoluble SEI layer containing more organic constituents. The CO 2  is incorporated in the dimethyl carbonate soluble part of the SEI composed primarily of polymeric poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) on the surface of a thin inorganic layer. This combination of properties from CO 2  addition provides an improved cycling performance through the reduction of irreversible side reactions, leading to higher coulombic efficiency. The results indicate that CO 2  incorporates into the SEI and plays a role similar to additives like fluorinated ethylene carbonate and vinylene carbonate with respect to polymeric components. },

An emerging concept of \u201cnanoarchitectonics\u201d has been proposed as a way to apply the progress of nanotechnology to materials science. In the introductory parts, we briefly explain the progress in understanding materials through nanotechnology, the overview of nanoarchitectonics, the effects of nanoarchitectonics on the development of functional materials and devices, and outline of nanoarchitectonics intelligence as a main subject of this review paper. In the following sections, we explain the process of constructing intelligent devices based on atomic switches, in which the behavior of atoms determines the device functions, by integrating them with nanoarchitectonics. The contents are categorized into (i) basic operation of atomic switch, (ii) artificial synapse, (iii) neuromorphic network system, (iv) hetero-signal conversion, (v) decision making device, and (vi) atomic switch in practical uses. The atomic switches were originally relatively simple ON\/OFF binary-type electrical devices, but their potential as multi-level resistive memory devices for artificial synapses and neuromorphic applications. Furthermore, network-structured atomic switches, which are complex and have regression pathways in their structure and resemble cranial neural circuits. For example, A decision-making device that reproduces human thinking based on a principle different from brain neural circuits was developed using atomic switches and proton-conductive electrochemical cells. Furthermore, atomic switches have been progressively developed into practical usages including application in harsh environments (e.g. high temperature, low temperature, space). Efforts toward information processing and artificial intelligence applications based on nanoarchitectonics tell remarkable success stories of nanoarchitectonics, linking the control of atomic motion to brain-like information control through nanoarchitecture regulations. },

The effects of yttrium dopants on the phase change behavior and microstructure of Sn 15 Sb 85  films have been systematically investigated. The yttrium-doped Sn 15 Sb 85  film has the higher phase transition temperature, ten year data retention ability and crystallization activation energy, which represent a great improvement in thermal stability and data retention. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the amorphous Sn and Y components restrict the grain growth and decrease the grain size. Raman mode typically associated with Sb is altered when the substance crystallized. Atomic force microscopy results show that the surface morphology of the doped films becomes smoother. T-shaped phase change storage cells based on yttrium-doped Sn 15 Sb 85  films exhibit the lower power consumption. The results demonstrate that the crystallization characteristics of Sn 15 Sb 85  film can be tuned and optimized through the yttrium dopant for the excellent performances of phase change memory. },

The layer-by-layer (LbL) technique has been proven to be one of the most versatile approaches in order to fabricate functional nanofilms. The use of simple and inexpensive procedures as well as the possibility to incorporate a very wide range of materials through different interactions have driven its application in a wide range of fields. On the other hand, field-effect transistors (FETs) are certainly among the most important elements in electronics. The ability to modulate the flowing current between a source and a drain electrode via the voltage applied to the gate electrode endow these devices to switch or amplify electronic signals, being vital in all of our everyday electronic devices. In this topical review, we highlight different research efforts to engineer field-effect transistors using the LbL assembly approach. We firstly discuss on the engineering of the channel material of transistors via the LbL technique. Next, the deposition of dielectric materials through this approach is reviewed, allowing the development of high-performance electronic components. Finally, the application of the LbL approach to fabricate FETs-based biosensing devices is also discussed, as well as the improvement of the transistor\u2019s interfacial sensitivity by the engineering of the semiconductor with polyelectrolyte multilayers. },

Glioma is the most aggressive type of brain tumors encountered in medical practice. The high frequency of diagnosed cases and risk of metastasis, the low efficiency of traditional therapy, and the usually unfavorable prognosis for patients dictate the need to develop alternative or combined approaches for an early diagnosis and treatment of this pathology. High expectations are placed on the use of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). In this study, we have produced and characterized UCNPs doped with the rare-earth elements ytterbium and thulium. Our UCNPs had photoluminescence emission maxima inthe visible and infrared spectral regions, which allow for deep optical imaging of tumor cells in the brain. Moreover, we evaluated the toxicity effects of our UCNPs on a normal brain and glioma cells. It was revealed thatour UCNPs are non-toxic to glioma cells but have a moderate cytotoxic effect on primary neuronal cultures at high concentrations, a condition that is characterized by a decreased cellular viability and changes in thefunctional metabolic activity of neuron-glial networks. Despite the great potential associated with the use of these UCNPs as fluorescent markers, there is a need for further studies on the rate of the UCNPsaccumulation and excretion in normal and tumor brain cells, and the use of their surface modifications in order to reduce their cytotoxic effects. },

A liquid thermoelectric conversion device (LTE), which has a simple device structure composed of low-cost materials, is attracting attention.

We \u00a0ascribed to the enhancement of the thermal voltage  V  and electrochemical Seebeck coefficient \u03b1 to precipitation of K 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ] and resultant concentration gradient of [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3\u2212  between the hot and cold electrodes. The enhancement of  V  and  \u03b1  is quantitatively reproduced by the concentration gradient model incorporating experimentally-obtained solubility  s ( T ) of K 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ]. We further demonstrated that precipitation enhances the maximum power by as much as 152% in a MeOH-added LTE composed of 0.35 M K 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ]\/K 3 [Fe(CN) 6 ] aqueous solution at \u0394 T  = 10 K. },

Cutting-edge thin film studies using multiple-angle incidence resolution spectrometry (MAIRS) are introduced from the principle to forefront applications in a wide variety of research fields covering semiconductor material with respect to nanoarchitectonics. MAIRS basically reveals quantitatively optical anisotropy in thin films, which is mostly used for quantitative molecular orientation analysis of each chemical group for chemistry purposes. This works powerfully especially when the material has poor crystallinity that cannot be analyzed by X-ray diffraction. As a matter of fact, MAIRS works in a role that compensates for the diffraction techniques, and the combination of MAIRS and the diffraction techniques has already been established as the most powerful technique not to miss the molecular aggregation structure in thin films. In this review, in addition, another application for physics purposes is also introduced where phonon in thin films is discriminated from normal infrared absorption bands by using the MAIRS technique. },

A novel method of fabricating multifaceted and nanobored particle arrays via colloidal lithography using colloidal\u2010crystal layers as masks for anisotropic reactive\u2010ion etching (RIE) is reported. The shape of the sculpted particles is dependent on the crystal orientation relative to the etchant flow, the number of colloidal layers, the RIE conditions, and the matrix (or mask) structure in colloidal lithography. Arrays of non\u2010spherical particles with sculpted shapes, which to date could not otherwise be produced, are fabricated using a tilted anisotropic RIE process and the layer\u2010by\u2010layer growth of a colloidal mask. These non\u2010spherical particles and their ordered arrays can be used for antireflection surfaces, biosensors, and nanopatterning masks, as well as non\u2010spherical building blocks for novel colloidal crystals. In addition, polymeric particles with patterned holes of controlled depths obtained by the present method can be applied to the fabrication of functional composite particles. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
The macroscopic viscoelastic properties of a physical hydrogel are reversibly modulated by tuning the microscopic hydrogen\u2010bonding interactions with pH. The hydrogel forms at a rather low concentration of the multi\u2010pyridyl\u2010based gelator,  N ,  N \u2032,  N \u2033\u2010tris(3\u2010pyridyl)trimesic amide. The yield stress of the hydrogel is greatly enhanced from 10 to 769\u2009Pa by changing the pH from 7.0 to 5.0. At pH\u20097.0, the amide molecules are assembled into an ordered structure as a result of the hydrogen bonds between the amide N\u2013H bond and the nitrogen on the pyridyl group (N\u2013H\u2026Py). Fourier transform (FT) IR spectroscopy indicates that hydrogen bonds of N\u2013H\u2026Py are partially broken because the pyridyl groups are partly protonated at pH\u20095.0. This condition leads to a highly branched and homogeneous fibrillar network, which is confirmed by X\u2010ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and field\u2010emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images. Highly branched fibrillar networks create more compartments and greatly increase the interfacial tension that is required to hold the solvent in the gel, thereby increasing the yield stress to 769\u2009Pa. By further increasing the acidity of the hydrogel to pH\u2009<\u20093.0, the gel becomes a sol. Both the change in the viscoelastic properties and the sol\u2013gel transition are reversible and controllable in the material. },

2D nanoscale oxides have attracted a large amount of research interest due to their unique properties. Here, a facile synthetic approach to prepare graphene\u2010mimicking, porous 2D Co 3 O 4  nanofoils using graphene oxide (GO) as a sacrificial template is reported. The thermal instability of graphene, as well as the catalytic ability of Co 3 O 4  particles to degrade carbon backbones, allow the fabrication of porous 2D Co 3 O 4  nanofoils without the loss of the 2D nature of GO. Based on these results, a graphene mimicking as a route for large\u2010area 2D transition metal oxides for applications in electrochemical energy storage devices is proposed. As a proof of concept, it is demonstrated that graphene\u2010like, porous 2D Co 3 O 4  nanofoils exhibit a high reversible capacity (1279.2 mAh g \u22121 ), even after 50 cycles. This capacity is far beyond the theoretical capacity of Co 3 O 4  based on the conversion mechanism from Co 3 O 4  to Li 2 O and metallic Co. },

However, some issues, such as the low conductivity and the large volume variation of sulfur, as well as the formation of polysulfides during cycling, are yet to be addressed before LSBs can become an actual reality. Here, presented is a comprehensive overview illustrating the techniques capable of mitigating these undesirable problems together with the electrochemical performances associated to the different proposed solutions. In particular, the analysis is organized by separately addressing cathode, anode, separator, and electrolyte. Furthermore, to better understand the chemistry and failure mechanisms of LSBs, important characterization techniques applied to energy storage systems are reviewed. Similarly, considerations on the theoretical approaches used in the energy storage field are provided, as they can become the key tool for the design of the next generation LSBs. Afterward, the state of the art of LSBs technology is presented from a geopolitical perspective by comparing the results achieved in this field by the main world actors, namely Asia, North America, and Europe. Finally, this review is concluded with the application status of LSBs technology, and its prospects are offered. },

Owing to the negative impact of the extensive utilization of batteries on the environment, sustainability of the cells needs to be included in the systemic research of batteries. Herein, a dissolvable ionic crosslinked polymer (DICP) is exploited as a binder for lithium\u2013sulfur batteries by crosslinking the polyacrylic acid and polyethyleneimine through carboxy\u2010amino ionic interaction. This interaction is pH\u2010controlled, and therefore, the crosslinked binder network can be readily dissociated under basic conditions, providing a facile strategy enabling valuable components recycled through a convenient washing method. The sulfur cathode prepared using the recycled carbon\u2013sulfur composite can deliver comparable capacity as that of fresh electrode. In addition, evidence from cell performance and characterizations, such as in situ X\u2010ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ UV\u2013visible spectroscopy, X\u2010ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculation, confirms that DICP is a more effective binder than its commercial counterpart on suppressing polysulfide dissolution in the electrolyte. Exploiting reversible crosslinked polymer binder for recyclable Li\u2013S batteries with ameliorated electrochemical performance, this study illuminates sustainable development for large\u2010scale energy storage systems. },

While tremendous advances have been made in dimensionality\u2010dependent performances of inorganic\u2010based low\u2010dimensional nanostructures, paradigms concerning \u03c0\u2010conjugated molecule\u2010based supramolecular nanoassemblies are relatively fewer despite their various intrinsic advantages. It is herein reported that 0D, 1D, and 2D supramolecular nanostructures of a porphyrin, 5,10,15,20\u2010tetrakis(4\u2010aminophenyl)\u201021H,23H\u2010porphine, with a spherical, fibrous and sheetlike architecture, respectively, could be fabricated via a reprecipitation protocol. As a typical example to demonstrate their dimensionality\u2010dependent optoelectronic performances, it is shown that the nanomaterials could serve as photocatalysts for water remediation, where the catalytic reactivity exhibits a trend of nanofibers > nanospheres > nanosheets. The superior catalytic reactivity of the nanofibers stems from the formation of relatively well\u2010defined J\u2010aggregates with orderly and tightly organized chromophores, conferring them with strong photoinduced electron\u2013hole transport and separation capability. The higher catalytic reactivity of the nanospheres than nanosheets results from their larger specific surface area, which facilitates efficient accessibility of photogenerated charge carriers, although the porphyrins therein form unspecific J\u2010aggregates with disorderly and loosely stacked chromophores. The investigation likely initiates a simple method for \u03c0\u2010conjugated molecule\u2010based 0D, 1D and 2D nanoassemblies by using the same tectons, based on which the highlighted underlying scientific insights might provide useful clues for rational design of organic\u2010based low\u2010dimensional advanced soft materials. },

Antimicrobial polymers are a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Cationic bottle brush copolymers have shown to be superior to linear topologies in previous studies. Herein, the aspect ratio of such polymers is varied creating differently shaped confined unimolecular structures with varying degrees of side chain mobility. Using reversible addition\u2010fragmentation chain\u2010transfer (RAFT) polymerization, bottle brushes are produced in a one\u2010pot procedure. The morphology is confirmed by atomic force microscopy. The hydrophobicity, as determined via high performance\u2010liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, is drastically influenced by the topology. Using Fourier\u2010transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, it is found that polymers with a high side chain mobility and increased global hydrophilicity, are less hydrated, and have stronger intramolecular hydrogen bonds. A phase segregated morphology leading to unimolecular micellization is assumed. Biological tests reveal increased antimicrobial activity for such segregated polymers. Their excellent hemocompatibility results in highly selective antimicrobial polymers whose adaptability seems to be a key feature in their excellent performance. This study highlights the tremendous importance of structural control in antimicrobial polymers. },

Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), an emerging energy conversion technology, offers innovative pathways for energy harvesting and self\u2010powered sensing. To achieve superior performance, researchers commonly employ substantial quantities of original or treated polymers, resulting in high energy and precise sensing. Nevertheless, the sustainable development of TENGs faces significant challenges related to environmental compatibility, pollution hazards, and high production and disposal costs. To address this issue, numerous green materials for diverse TENGs are introduced and advanced. These materials may encompass natural resources, household waste, and recyclable materials, among others. Consequently, a review of the progress in TENGs based on green materials, which can be called green TENGs, becomes imperative to advance its sustainable development. To this end, this work comprehensively elucidates the development of green TENGs from the perspective of materials processing and treatment degree for the first time. Various green TENGs, including food waste, discarded daily\u2010use items, plant organs, biodegradable industrial products, and natural cellulose, are meticulously categorized. This review not only systematically synthesizes the latest research advancements in green TENGs, but also offers insight into their processing methodologies, working characteristics, and potential application scenarios. Finally, it envisions the challenges, proposed solutions, and future research directions for the development of green TENGs. },

Enhancing cardiomyocyte (CM) maturation by topographical cues is a critical issue in cardiac tissue engineering. Thus far, single\u2010scale topographies with a broad range of feature shapes and dimensions have been utilized including grooves, pillars, and fibers. This study reports for the first time a hierarchical structure composed of nano\u2010pillars (nPs) on micro\u2010wrinkles (\u00b5Ws) for effective maturation of CMs. Through capillary force lithography followed by a wrinkling process, vast size ranges of topographies are fabricated, and the responses of CMs are systematically investigated. Maturation of CMs on the hierarchical structures is highly enhanced compared to a single\u2010scale topography: cardiac differentiation of H9C2s (rat cardiomyocytes) on the hierarchical topography is \u2248 2.8 and \u2248 1.9 times higher than those consisting of single\u2010scale \u00b5Ws and nPs. Both nPs and \u00b5Ws have important roles in cardiac maturation, and the aspect ratio (height\/diameter) of the nPs and the wavelength of the \u00b5Ws are important in CM maturation. This enhancement is caused by strong focal adhesion and nucleus mediated mechanotransduction of CMs from the confinement effects of the different wavelengths of \u00b5Ws and the cellular membrane protrusion on the nPs. This study demonstrates how a large family of hierarchical structures is used for cardiac maturation. },

Surfaces with biological functionalities are of great interest for biomaterials, tissue engineering, biophysics, and for controlling biological processes. The layer\u2010by\u2010layer (LbL) assembly is a highly versatile methodology introduced 30 years ago, which consists of assembling complementary polyelectrolytes or biomolecules in a stepwise manner to form thin self\u2010assembled films. In view of its simplicity, compatibility with biological molecules, and adaptability to any kind of supporting material carrier, this technology has undergone major developments over the past decades. Specific applications have emerged in different biomedical fields owing to the possibility to load or immobilize biomolecules with preserved bioactivity, to use an extremely broad range of biomolecules and supporting carriers, and to modify the film's mechanical properties via crosslinking. In this review, the focus is on the recent developments regarding LbL films formed as 2D or 3D objects for applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering. Possible applications in the fields of vaccinology, 3D biomimetic tissue models, as well as bone and cardiovascular tissue engineering are highlighted. In addition, the most recent technological developments in the field of film construction, such as high\u2010content liquid handling or machine learning, which are expected to open new perspectives in the future developments of LbL, are presented. },

Molecular electronics seeks to incorporate molecular components as functional elements in electronic devices.

This progress report focuses on experimental methods for making both single\u2010molecule and ensemble molecular junctions, and highlights key results from these efforts. Based on some general objectives of the field, particular experiments are presented to show progress in several important areas, and also to define those areas that still need attention. Some of the variable behavior of ostensibly similar junctions reported in the literature is attributable to differences in the way the junctions are fabricated. These differences are due, in part, to the multitude of methods for supporting the molecular layer on the substrate, including methods that utilize physical adsorption and covalent bonds, and to the numerous strategies for making top contacts. After discussing recent experimental progress in molecular electronics, an assessment of the current state of the field is presented, along with a proposed road map that can be used to assess progress in the future. },

In situations of power outage or shortage, such as periods just following a seismic disaster, the only reliable power source available is the most fundamental of forces i.e., manual mechanical stimuli. Although there are many macroscopic mechanical tools, mechanical control of nanomaterials and nanosystems has not been an easy subject to develop even by using advanced nanotechnological concepts. However, this challenge has now become a hot topic and many new ideas and strategies have been proposed recently. This report summarizes recent research examples of mechanical control of nanomaterials and nanosystems. Creation of macroscopic mechanical outputs by efficient accumulation of molecular\u2010level phenomena is first briefly introduced. We will then introduce the main subject: control of molecular systems by macroscopic mechanical stimuli. The research described is categorized according to the respective areas of mechanical control of molecular structure, molecular orientation, molecular interaction including cleavage and healing, and biological and micron\u2010level phenomena. Finally, we will introduce two more advanced approaches, namely, mechanical strategies for microdevice fabrication and mechanical control of molecular machines. As mechanical forces are much more reliable and widely applicable than other stimuli, we believe that development of mechanically responsive nanomaterials and nanosystems will make a significant contribution to fundamental improvements in our lifestyles and help to maintain and stabilize our society. },

In this review, we summarize recent research on LB and related methods including (i) advanced design for LB films, (ii) LB film as a medium for supramolecular chemistry, (iii) LB technique for nanofabrication and (iv) LB involving advanced nanomaterials. Finally, a comparison between LB and LbL techniques is made.

Aggregation\u2010induced emission (AIE) refers to a photophysical phenomenon shown by a group of luminogenic materials that are non\u2010emissive when they are dissolved in good solvents as molecules but become highly luminescent when they are clustered in poor solvents or solid state as aggregates. In this Review we summarize the recent progresses made in the area of AIE research. We conduct mechanistic analyses of the AIE processes, unify the restriction of intramolecular motions (RIM) as the main cause for the AIE effects, and derive RIM\u2010based molecular engineering strategies for the design of new AIE luminogens (AIEgens). Typical examples of the newly developed AIEgens and their high\u2010tech applications as optoelectronic materials, chemical sensors and biomedical probes are presented and discussed. },

Objects in all dimensions are subject to translational dynamism and dynamic mutual interactions, and the ability to exert control over these events is one of the keys to the synthesis of functional materials. For the development of materials with truly dynamic functionalities, a paradigm shift from \u201cnanotechnology\u201d to \u201cnanoarchitectonics\u201d is proposed, with the aim of design and preparation of functional materials through dynamic harmonization of atomic\u2010\/molecular\u2010level manipulation and control, chemical nanofabrication, self\u2010organization, and field\u2010controlled organization. Here, various examples of dynamic functional materials are presented from the atom\/molecular\u2010level to macroscopic dimensions.

The critical differences between microtechnology and nanotechnology are discussed, and the necessity of a new paradigm, nanoarchitectonics, is proposed for the future development of nanotechnology. An important task in material fabrication is to harmonize various factors and effects, and to combine them into functional nanomaterials and nanosystems. It is the way of architectonics rather than that of an individual technology. Therefore, a novel terminology, nanoarchitectonics (nano + architecto +nics) has been proposed as a new paradigm of materials science and technology on the nanoscale. The statement by Feynman that \u201cthere's plenty of room at the bottom\u201d is really true. With nanoarchitectonics in our hands, we can re\u2010open the door to Feynman's huge room. },

Optical components made fully or partially from reconfigurable, stimuli\u2010responsive, soft solids or fluids\u2014collectively referred to as soft photonics\u2014are poised to form the platform for tunable optical devices with unprecedented functionality and performance characteristics. Currently, however, soft solid and fluid material systems still represent an underutilized class of materials in the optical engineers' toolbox. This is in part due to challenges in fabrication, integration, and structural control on the nano\u2010 and microscale associated with the application of soft components in optics. These challenges might be addressed with the help of a resourceful ally: nature. Organisms from many different phyla have evolved an impressive arsenal of light manipulation strategies that rely on the ability to generate and dynamically reconfigure hierarchically structured, complex optical material designs, often involving soft or fluid components. A comprehensive understanding of design concepts, structure formation principles, material integration, and control mechanisms employed in biological photonic systems will allow this study to challenge current paradigms in optical technology. This review provides an overview of recent developments in the fields of soft photonics and biologically inspired optics, emphasizes the ties between the two fields, and outlines future opportunities that result from advancements in soft and bioinspired photonics. },

Controlling movements of electrons and holes is the key task in developing today's highly sophisticated information society. As transistors reach their physical limits, the semiconductor industry is seeking the next alternative to sustain its economy and to unfold a new era of human civilization. In this context, a completely new information token, i.e., ions instead of electrons, is promising. The current trend in solid\u2010state nanoionics for applications in energy storage, sensing, and brain\u2010type information processing, requires the ability to control the properties of matter at the ultimate atomic scale. Here, a conceptually novel nanoarchitectonic strategy is proposed for controlling the number of dopant atoms in a solid electrolyte to obtain discrete electrical properties. Using \u03b1\u2010Ag 2+   \u03b4  S nanodots with a finite number of nonstoichiometry excess dopants as a model system, a theory matched with experiments is presented that reveals the role of physical parameters, namely, the separation between electrochemical energy levels and the cohesive energy, underlying atomic\u2010scale manipulation of dopants in nanodots. This strategy can be applied to different nanoscale materials as their properties strongly depend on the number of doping atoms\/ions, and has the potential to create a new paradigm based on controlled single atom\/ion transfer. },

The layered nickel\u2010rich materials have attracted extensive attention as a promising cathode candidate for high\u2010energy density lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs). However, they have been suffering from inherent structural and electrochemical degradation including severe capacity loss at high electrode loading density (>3.0 g cm \u22123 ) and high temperature cycling (>60 \u00b0C). In this study, an effective and viable way of creating an artificial solid\u2013electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the cathode surface by a simple, one\u2010step approach is reported. It is found that the initial artificial SEI compounds on the cathode surface can electrochemically grow along grain boundaries by reacting with the by\u2010products during battery cycling. The developed nickel\u2010rich cathode demonstrates exceptional capacity retention and structural integrity under industrial electrode fabricating conditions with the electrode loading level of \u224812 mg cm \u22122  and density of \u22483.3 g cm \u22123 . This finding could be a breakthrough for the LIB technology, providing a rational approach for the development of advanced cathode materials. },

Although metallic lithium is an extremely promising anode for lithium\u2010based batteries due to its high theoretical capacity, the uncontrollable growth of lithium dendrites, in particular under deep stripping and plating, have stagnated its application. It is demonstrated that parallelly aligned MXene (Ti 3 C 2 T  x \n ) layers enable the efficient guiding of lithium nucleation and growth on the surface of 2D MXene nanosheets, giving rise to horizontal\u2010growth lithium anodes. Moreover, the inherent fluorine terminations in MXene afford a uniform and durable solid electrolyte interface with lithium fluoride at the anode\/electrolyte interface, efficiently regulating electromigration of lithium ions. Thus, a dendrite\u2010free lithium anode with a long cycle life up to 900 h and excellent deep stripping\u2013plating capabilities up to 35 mAh cm \u22122  is achieved, which can further serve as an anode for a lithium metal battery, exhibiting high cycle stability up to 1000 cycles. },

Exploration of molecular functions and material properties based on the control of chirality would be a scientifically elegant approach. Here, the fabrication and function of chiral\u2010featured materials from both chiral and achiral components using a supramolecular nanoarchitectonics concept are discussed. The contents are classified in to three topics: i) chiral nanoarchitectonics of rather general molecular assemblies; ii) chiral nanoarchitectonics of metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs); iii) chiral nanoarchitectonics in liquid crystals. MOF structures are based on nanoscopically well\u2010defined coordinations, while mesoscopic orientations of liquid\u2010crystalline phases are often flexibly altered. Discussion on the effects and features in these representative materials systems with totally different natures reveals the universal importance of supramolecular chiral nanoarchitectonics. Amplification of chiral molecular information from molecules to materials\u2010level structures and the creation of chirality from achiral components upon temporal statistic fluctuations are universal, regardless of the nature of the assemblies. These features are thus surely advantageous characteristics for a wide range of applications. },

There is a growing interest in the development of dynamic adaptive biomaterials for regulation of cellular functions. However, existing materials are limited to two\u2010state switching of the presentation and removal of cell\u2010adhesive bioactive motifs that cannot emulate the native extracellular matrix (ECM) in vivo with continuously adjustable characteristics. Here, tunable adaptive materials composed of a protein monolayer assembled at a liquid\u2013liquid interface are demonstrated, which adapt dynamically to cell traction forces. An ultrastructure transition from protein monolayer to hierarchical fiber occurs through interfacial jamming. Elongated fibronectin fibers promote formation of elongated focal adhesion structures, increase focal adhesion kinase activation, and enhance neuronal differentiation of stem cells. Cell traction force results in spatial rearrangement of ECM proteins, which feeds back to alter stem cell fate. The reported biomimetic adaptive liquid interface enables dynamic control of stem cell behavior and has potential translational applications. },

Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are quasi\u20101D graphene strips, which have attracted attention as a novel class of semiconducting materials for various applications in electronics and optoelectronics. GNRs exhibit unique electronic and optical properties, which sensitively depend on their chemical structures, especially the width and edge configuration. Therefore, precision synthesis of GNRs with chemically defined structures is crucial for their fundamental studies as well as device applications. In contrast to top\u2010down methods, bottom\u2010up chemical synthesis using tailor\u2010made molecular precursors can achieve atomically precise GNRs. Here, the synthesis of GNRs on metal surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) conditions is the main focus, and the recent progress in the field is summarized. The UHV method leads to successful unambiguous visualization of atomically precise structures of various GNRs with different edge configurations. The CVD protocol, in contrast, achieves simpler and industry\u2010viable fabrication of GNRs, allowing for the scale up and efficient integration of the as\u2010grown GNRs into devices. The recent updates in device studies are also addressed using GNRs synthesized by both the UHV method and CVD, mainly for transistor applications. Furthermore, views on the next steps and challenges in the field of on\u2010surface synthesized GNRs are provided. },

Discussions from conceptual viewpoints and example recent developments, chiefly focused on nanoporous materials, are presented.

Layers of aligned dyes are key to photo\u2010driven charge separation in dye sensitized solar cells, but cannot be exploited as rectifying membranes in photocatalysis to separate half\u2010cells because they are not sufficiently stable. While impressive work on the fabrication of stable noncovalent membranes has been recently demonstrated, these membranes are inherently suffering from non\u2010uniform orientation of the constituting dyes. To stabilize layers made from uniformly assembled and aligned dyes, they can be covalently cross\u2010linked via functional groups or via chromophores at the expense of their optical properties. Here stable membranes from established dyes are reported that do not need to be elaborately functionalized nor do their chromophores need to be destroyed. These membranes are free\u2010standing, although being only non\u2010covalently linked. To enable uniform dye\u2010alignment, Langmuir layers made from linear, water\u2010insoluble dyes are used. That water\u2010soluble charge transfer dyes adsorb onto and intercalate into the Langmuir layer from the aqueous subphase, thus yielding free\u2010standing, molecularly thin membranes are demonstrated. The developed bifacial layers consist almost entirely of \u03c0\u2010conjugated units and thus can conduct charges and can be further engineered for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications. },

Unimolecular current rectifiers are fundamental building blocks in organic electronics. Rectifying behavior has been identified in numerous organic systems due to electron\u2010hole asymmetries of orbital levels interfaced by a metal electrode. As a consequence, the rectifying ratio (RR) determining the diode efficiency remains fixed for a chosen molecule\u2010metal interface. Here, a mechanically tunable molecular diode exhibiting an exceptionally large rectification ratio (>10 5 ) and reversible direction is presented. The molecular system comprises a seven\u2010armchair graphene nanoribbon (GNR) doped with a single unit of substitutional diboron within its structure, synthesized with atomic precision on a gold substrate by on\u2010surface synthesis. The diboron unit creates half\u2010populated in\u2010gap bound states and splits the GNR frontier bands into two segments, localizing the bound state in a double barrier configuration. By suspending these GNRs freely between the tip of a low\u2010temperature scanning tunneling microscope and the substrate, unipolar hole transport is demonstrated through the boron in\u2010gap state's resonance. Strong current rectification is observed, associated with the varying widths of the two barriers, which can be tuned by altering the distance between tip and substrate. This study introduces an innovative approach for the precise manipulation of molecular electronic functionalities, opening new avenues for advanced applications in organic\u00a0electronics. },

In this contribution, a novel method for practical uses in the fabrication of the top contact electrode in a metal\/organic monolayer\/metal device is presented. The procedure involves the thermally induced decomposition of an organometallic compound, abbreviated as the TIDOC method. Monolayers incorporating the metal organic compounds (MOCs) [[4\u2010{(4\u2010carboxy)ethynyl}phenyl]ethynyl]\u2010(triphenylphosphine)\u2010gold, 1, or [1\u2010isocyano\u20104\u2010methoxybenzene]\u2010[4\u2010amino\u2010phenylethynyl]\u2010gold, 2, were annealed at moderate temperatures (1: 150 \u00b0C for 2h and 2: 100 \u00b0C for 2 h), resulting in cleavage of the Au\u2010P or Au\u2010C bond and reduction of Au(I) to Au(0) as metallic gold nanoparticles (GNPs). These particles are distributed on the surface of the film resulting in formation of metal\/molecule\/GNP sandwich structures. Electrical properties of these nascent devices were determined by recording  I\u2013V  curves with a conductive\u2010AFM. The  I\u2013V  curves collected from these metal\/organic monolayer\/GNPs sandwich structures are typical of metal\u2010molecule\u2010metal junctions, with no low resistance traces characteristic of metallic short circuits observed over a wide range of set\u2010point forces. The TIDOC method is therefore an effective procedure for the fabrication of molecular junctions for the emerging area of molecular electronics. },

Ultrathin 2D nanoporous materials offer enhanced sensitivity and high spatial resolution in sensing applications making them important for the selective discrimination of guest molecules. Here bottom\u2010up fabrication is reported of a novel molecularly\u2010thin nitrogen\u2010doped 2D fullerphene. Thermal annealing at 700\u00a0\u00b0C of a bottom\u2010up assembled fullerene C 60 \u2010ethylenediamine (EDA) thin film results in formation of a nitrogen\u2010doped ultrathin carbon film, fullerphene, which exhibits a hierarchically micro\/mesoporous structure at its surfaces. N\u2010doping of fullerphene is dominated by pyrrolic and quaternary nitrogen atoms, which allow selective and repetitive adsorption and desorption of low\u2010molecular\u2010weight carboxylic acid vapors through noncovalent interactions. The large surface area (655.2 m 2  g \u20131 ) and pore volume (0.659 cc g \u20131 ) offered by the hierarchical micro\/mesoporous architecture leads to superior sensitivity of fullerphene to formic acid over acetic acid in the vapor phase demonstrating that novel 2D fullerphene provides an attractive platform for the discrimination of carboxylic acids at the single\u2010carbon\u2010atom level. },

Although some bright, organic mechanoluminescence (ML) luminogens with aggregation\u2010induced emission properties and twisted molecular structures are recently reported, those with planar structures and bright ML and their related effective design strategies are not yet explored, partially due to aggregation\u2010caused quenching in luminogens with planar structures. Herein, using the unique solid\u2010state packing style of pyrene, bright dual monomer\u2010excimer\u2010ML and excimer\u2010ML from two pyrene derivatives (Py\u2010Bpin and Py\u2010Br) with a simple, planar molecular structure are reported for the first time, and two analogs of pyrene and Py\u2010H are used for comparison. These four luminogens display similar optical properties in dilute solution but different luminescent properties in the solid state, mainly due to their different molecular packing. Interestingly, pyrene is mechanochromism (MC)\u2010 and ML\u2010inactive, while Py\u2010H is MC\u2010active, Py\u2010Bpin is MC\u2010 and ML\u2010active, and Py\u2010Br is ML\u2010active. The relationship between molecular packing and ML\/MC properties is confirmed by analyzing single\u2010crystal structures and related experimental results, providing important information to further understand the mysterious ML process and opening a new way to design efficient luminogens with both MC and ML. },

Fluorescence photoswitching systems using photochromic molecules, which turn on and off their fluorescence upon light irradiation, have emerged as highly promising material systems during the past two decades related to their optoelectronic applications such as high\u2010density optical memory, bioimaging, and super\u2010resolution microscopy. Single\u2010color fluorescence photoswitching, which provides only two different states (on\/off), is limited in terms of its practical applications such as interference from autofluorescence in biological applications and limited switching states in logic gate and optical memory applications. To address such issues, studies on multicolor fluorescence photoswitching systems incorporating photochromic molecules have witnessed an explosive growth in the past decade in terms of the academic principles and technological applications. In the earlier part, this review briefly introduces the principle of fluorescence photoswitching based on the representative single\u2010color fluorescence photoswitching systems. Then, the review turns into the main topic of multicolor fluorescence photoswitching systems which are organized in two different subcategories of 1) color\u2010correlated photoswitching and 2) color\u2010specific photoswitching. Not only the material systems and principles of the multicolor fluorescence photoswitching, but also their important applications are described and discussed here. In the last section of this review, a brief summary and outlook on the future development are provided. },

2D materials possess exceptional physical and chemical properties that render them appealing components for numerous potential applications in (opto)electronics, energy storage, sensing, and biomedicine. However, such unique properties are hardly tunable or modifiable. The functionalization of 2D crystals with molecules constitutes a powerful strategy to adjust and modulate their properties, by also imparting them new functions. In this framework, the combination of 2D materials with photosensitive molecules is a viable route for harnessing their light\u2010responsive nature. The latter takes full advantage of the extremely high sensitivity of 2D materials to subtle changes in the local environment and the capacity of photosensitive molecules to modify their intrinsic properties when exposed to electromagnetic fields. The hybrid molecule\u20132D materials can preserve the unique optical and electrical properties of 2D layers and can exhibit additional light\u2010tunable features. In this Progress Report, the protocols that can be pursued for the 2D material functionalization and switching mechanisms in photosensitive systems are reviewed, followed by an in\u2010depth discussion on their tunable optical properties and their exploitation when integrated in novel photoswitchable electronic devices. The opportunities and associated challenges to be tackled for the development of unprecedented and high\u2010performance light\u2010responsive devices are discussed. },

Plasmonic enhancement of absorption in charge\u2010transfer (CT) complexes formed under NO 2  gas adsorption onto 2D hybrid structure, based on the metal\u2013organic monolayer and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), is demonstrated. By using Langmuir\u2013Blodgett deposition of low\u2010symmetry zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) molecules, the metal\u2013organic monolayer is fabricated with greatly suppressed intermolecular aggregation. Oxidation of the monolayer through coordination of NO 2  molecules with axial zinc ions of ZnPc molecules gives rise to the specific absorption band inherited to cation radical ZnPc + . The hybrid AuNPs\u2013ZnPc structure is engineered to maximize exciton\u2013plasmon interaction of CT complexes at the radical form of the metal\u2013organic monolayer. Excellent spectral and spatial overlaps with plasmon resonance boost absorption of CT internal optical transition, so\u2010called \u201cfingerprint\u201d band, by a factor of six from 0.45% to 2.8% in total. The approach paves the way for efficient plasmonic control over photochemical reactions promoted by charge\u2010transfer complexes in metal\u2013organic films. In particular, the plasmonic effect is harnessed to improve NO 2  gas sensing properties; the experimental study shows a 15\u2010fold increase of the detection efficiency in the specific band of CT complexes under the gas exposure. },

Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are among the most promising candidates of high\u2010energy\u2010density devices for advanced energy storage. However, the growth of dendrites greatly hinders the practical applications of LMBs in portable electronics and electric vehicles. Constructing stable and efficient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is among the most effective strategies to inhibit the dendrite growth and thus to achieve a superior cycling performance. In this review, the mechanisms of SEI formation and models of SEI structure are briefly summarized. The analysis methods to probe the surface chemistry, surface morphology, electrochemical property, dynamic characteristics of SEI layer are emphasized. The critical factors affecting the SEI formation, such as electrolyte component, temperature, current density, are comprehensively debated. The efficient methods to modify SEI layer with the introduction of new electrolyte system and additives, ex\u2010situ\u2010formed protective layer, as well as electrode design, are summarized. Although these works afford new insights into SEI research, robust and precise routes for SEI modification with well\u2010designed structure, as well as understanding of the connection between structure and electrochemical performance, is still inadequate. A multidisciplinary approach is highly required to enable the formation of robust SEI for highly efficient energy storage systems. },

Chromism induced by changes in the electronic states of dye molecules due to surface adsorption is termed \u201cadsorchromism\u201d in this article. These changes of molecular electronic states are induced by protonation, aggregation, intramolecular structural changes, and other processes, depending on the surface environment. Intramolecular structural changes, such as co\u2010planarization and decreased molecular motion are the most characteristic and interesting behavior of dye molecules at the surfaces, resulting in spectral shift and\/or emission enhancement. In this review, adsorchromism at the surfaces of layered materials are summarized since their flexibility of interlayer distance, surface flatness, and transparency is suitable for a detailed observation. By understanding the relationship between adsorchromism and the electronic states of molecules on the surfaces, it will be possible to induce some desired functions which can be realized simply by adsorption, instead of complicated organic syntheses. Thus, adsorchromism has potential applications such as effective solar energy harvesting systems, or biological\/chemical sensors to visualize environmental changes. },

Logic\u2010in\u2010memory devices are a promising and powerful approach to realize data processing and storage driven by electrical bias. Here, an innovative strategy is reported to achieve the multistage photomodulation of 2D logic\u2010in\u2010memory devices, which is realized by controlling the photoisomerization of donor\u2013acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) on the surface of graphene. Alkyl chains with various carbon spacer lengths ( n \u00a0=\u00a01, 5, 11, and 17) are introduced onto DASAs to optimize the organic\u2013inorganic interfaces: 1) Prolonging the carbon spacers weakens the intermolecular aggregation and promotes isomerization in the solid state. 2) Too long alkyl chains induce crystallization on the surface and hinder the photoisomerization. Density functional theory calculation indicates that the photoisomerization of DASAs on the graphene surface is thermodynamically promoted by increasing the carbon spacer lengths. The 2D logic\u2010in\u2010memory devices are fabricated by assembling DASAs onto the surface. Green light irradiation increases the drain\u2013source current ( I  ds ) of the devices, while heat triggers a reversed transfer. The multistage photomodulation is achieved by well\u2010controlling the irradiation time and intensity. The strategy based on the dynamic control of 2D electronics by light integrates molecular programmability into the next generation of nanoelectronics. },

This study presents an innovative, statistically\u2010guided magnetron sputtering technique for creating nanoarchitectonics of high\u2010performing, NiFeMoN electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting. Using a central composite face\u2010centered (CCF) design, 13 experimental conditions are identified that enable precise optimization of synthesis parameters through response surface methodology (RSM), confirmed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The statistical analysis highlighted a interaction between Mo% and N% in the nanostructured NiFeMoN and found optimizing values at 31.35% Mo and 47.12% N. The NiFeMoN catalyst demonstrated superior performance with a low overpotential of 216\u00a0mV at 10\u00a0mA cm \u22122  and remarkable stability over seven days, attributed to the modifications in electronic structure and the creation of new active sites through Mo and N additions. Furthermore, the NiFeMoN coating, when used as a protective layer for a Si photoanode in 1\u00a0 m  KOH, achieved an applied\u2010bias photon\u2010to\u2010current efficiency (ABPE) of 5.2%, maintaining stability for 76 h. These advancements underscore the profound potential of employing statistical design for optimizing synthesis parameters of intricate catalyst materials via magnetron sputtering, paving the way for accelerated advancements in water splitting technologies and also in other energy conversion systems, such as nitrogen reduction and CO 2  conversion. },

The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of a resin composition on the performance of brake pads with durian seeds (BDs) as the base material. Experiments were done by attaching saw-milled BD particles to a polymer matrix. Various resin compositions were used for preparing the brake pad, which was then tested (press test, puncture test, and friction test). Physical properties (i.e., particle size, surface roughness, morphology, and density), as well as mechanical properties (ie: hardness, wear rate, and friction coefficient properties), were investigated. Based on observations, the best mechanical properties were found in the highest resin mixture, reaching a compressive strength value of 2.4 MPa. The impact of the homogeneity of the brake pad filler particles is the main reason. The high resin composition causes more cross-links to be formed. This research demonstrates the prospective environmentally friendly and inexpensive brake pads used to replace current products that use hazardous materials. },

To realize the continuous development of information and communication equipment, it is also important to develop devices with new operating principles that overcome the functional and performance limitations of conventional electronics devices, such as transistors made of semiconductor materials. One group of devices that hold this promise is nanoionics devices that operate by using local ion transport and electrochemical reaction in solids. A number of nanoionics devices that control nanoelectrochemical phenomena through the use of ionic nanoarchitectonics have been created. Here the use of ionic nanoarchitectonics to locally control ion transport and electrochemical reactions through the use of ion conductors or mixed conductors as device materials is described. Further, the structures of nanoionics devices created by using the nanoarchitectonics, as well as their various electrical, magnetic and optical functionalities are introduced. It is expected that such nanoionics devices will complement conventional electronics devices, and make possible the further development of information and communication technologies. },

There are growing concerns over the environmental, climate, and health impacts caused by using non\u2010renewable fossil fuels. The utilization of green energy, including solar and wind power, is believed to be one of the most promising alternatives to support more sustainable economic growth. In this regard, lithium\u2010ion batteries (LIBs) can play a critically important role. To further increase the energy and power densities of LIBs, silicon anodes have been intensively explored due to their high capacity, low operation potential, environmental friendliness, and high abundance. The main challenges for the practical implementation of silicon anodes, however, are the huge volume variation during lithiation and delithiation processes and the unstable solid\u2010electrolyte interphase (SEI) films. Recently, significant breakthroughs have been achieved utilizing advanced nanotechnologies in terms of increasing cycle life and enhancing charging rate performance due partially to the excellent mechanical properties of nanomaterials, high surface area, and fast lithium and electron transportation. Here, the most recent advance in the applications of 0D (nanoparticles), 1D (nanowires and nanotubes), and 2D (thin film) silicon nanomaterials in LIBs are summarized. The synthetic routes and electrochemical performance of these Si nanomaterials, and the underlying reaction mechanisms are systematically described. },

Lithium\u2013sulfur (Li\u2013S) batteries, due to the high theoretical energy density, are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for breaking the limitations of energy\u2010storage system based on Li\u2010ion batteries. Tremendous efforts have been made to meet the challenge of high\u2010performance Li\u2013S batteries, in which a sulfur loading of above 5 mg cm \u22122  delivers an areal capacity higher than 5 mAh cm \u22122  without compromising specific capacity and cycling stability for practical applications. However, serious problems have been exposed during the scaling up of the sulfur loading. In this review, based on mechanistic insights into structural configuration, catalytic conversion, and interfacial engineering, the problems and corresponding strategies in the development of high\u2010loading Li\u2013S batteries are highlighted and discussed, aiming at bridging the gap between fundamental research and practical cell\u2010level designs. Stemming from the current achievements, future directions targeting the high\u2010energy\u2010density Li\u2013S batteries for commercialization are proposed. },

Organic molecular aggregates have attracted widespread attention over the past decade owing to their unique optoelectronic properties in the aggregate state, which mainly involves the effects of aggregation structure as well as molecular packing mode. Although many examples of H\u2010 and J\u2010aggregates defined by molecular exciton model have been found, there are also other types of unconventional aggregates, especially for aggregation\u2010induced emission (AIE) system. In this review, the recent progress of some examples of basic and novel aggregate forms, as well as coassembled forms, presenting distinctive optical features, such as optical waveguide and polarization emission, polymorph\u2010dependent emission and stimuli\u2010responsive luminescence are presented. The systematic insight into the relationship between the aggregation structure and emission property is discussed. Guidelines are therefore anticipated and will direct the future preprogramming molecular design so as to fine\u2010tune the emission feature through a specific aggregation model for developing organic molecular aggregates with desirable optoelectronic properties. },

The purpose of this review is to summarize the effectiveness, modes of action and commercial application of herbal plants and their derivatives as growth promoters for animal. As described in literature, the increase in the growth of farming prices and feed costs for small ruminant in general, led to increases difficulties in production of livestock. To dissolve this issue, several studies concentrated on new alternative of feed resource, but others have tried to enrich milk products and meat by rising polyphenol compounds content to their by introductions of herbal plants in  sheep and goat feed. Currently, consumers demand safety and the quality of feeding. Since antibiotics can be leave residues in ruminant tissues, that could induce subsequent emergence of resistant strains of microorganisms capable of endangering the health of livestock and human. This scenario has given the impetus to explore alternatives to antibiotics in animal nutrition. Consequently, as replacement for the synthetic growth promoter\u2019s antibiotics, natural products like herbs and spice as natural feed additives come to the attention to enhance physiological functions. So,  the  use  of  feeds  containing bioactive  compounds such  as  thymol, flavonoids,  saponins, limonene,  thymoquinone, essential  oils  and others which concentrated in different parts, such as leaves, roots and seeds that can be used for these purpose in animal feed and responsible for the  healthy animal product. Furthermore, one of the hot points in the advanced research is the stability of animal product against the oxidative deterioration process that limits the shelf life. },

In the first chapter of this study the author stresses the importance of literature and Shakespeare's plays for our age. Although the enigma of Shakespeare's life still concerns many scholars it is relevant only as far as the solutions of some biographical details from Shakespeare's life influence the interpretation of his plays. In the section on feminism the focus of the author's attention is the changed role of women in the present day society as compared to previous centuries. In the final part of the article the role of the main female characters in Shakespeare's great tragedies is discussed. The author suggests that so far their importance has been underestimated and that Shakespeare left some of them open to different interpretations. Hamlet is definitely one of the most popular Shakespeare's plays in Slovenia and in addition to \"classical\" interpretations of this drama we have seen during the past two decades a number of experimental productions, done by both Slovene and foreign theatrical companies. In Appendix (1) the title of this paper is briefly discussed and the author' a work on Shakespeare is sketched; Appendix (2) presents a rap song on Hamlet written in English by a Slovene author. The song was used in the Glej Eperimental Theatre production (Hamlett\/Packard, Ljubljana, 1992). },

Gradual and reversible tuning of the torsion angle of an amphiphilic chiral binaphthyl, from \u221290\u00b0 to \u221280\u00b0, was achieved by application of a mechanical force to its molecular monolayer at the air\u2013water interface. This 2D interface was an ideal location for mechanochemistry for molecular tuning and its experimental and theoretical analysis, since this lowered dimension enables high orientation of molecules and large variation in the area. A small mechanical energy (<1\u2005kcal\u2009mol \u22121 ) was applied to the monolayer, causing a large variation (>50\u2009%) in the area of the monolayer and modification of binaphthyl conformation. Single\u2010molecule simulations revealed that mechanical energy was converted proportionally to torsional energy. Molecular dynamics simulations of the monolayer indicated that the global average torsion angle of a monolayer was gradually shifted. },

Deposition of Ni\u2010based cyanide bridged coordination polymer (NiCNNi) flakes onto the surfaces of graphene oxide (GO) sheets, which allows precise control of the resulting lamellar nanoarchitecture by in\u2005situ crystallization, is reported. GO sheets are utilized as nucleation sites that promote the optimized crystal growth of NiCNNi flakes. The NiCNNi\u2010coated GO sheets then self\u2010assemble and are stabilized as ordered lamellar nanomaterials. Regulated thermal treatment under nitrogen results in a Ni 3 C\u2013GO composite with a similar morphology to the starting material, and the Ni 3 C\u2013GO composite exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity and excellent durability for the oxygen reduction reaction. },

Two\u2010dimensional (2D) carbon nanomaterials possessing promising physical and chemical properties find applications in high\u2010performance energy storage devices and catalysts. However, large\u2010scale fabrication of 2D carbon nanostructures is based on a few specific carbon templates or precursors and poses a formidable challenge. Now a new bottom\u2010up method for carbon nanosheet fabrication using a newly designed anisotropic carbon nanoring molecule, CPPhen, is presented. CPPhen was self\u2010assembled at a dynamic air\u2013water interface with a vortex motion to afford molecular nanosheets, which were then carbonized under inert gas flow. Their nanosheet morphologies were retained after carbonization, which has never been seen for low\u2010molecular weight compounds. Furthermore, adding pyridine as a nitrogen dopant in the self\u2010assembly step successfully afforded nitrogen\u2010doped carbon nanosheets containing mainly pyridinic nitrogen species. },

Recent advances in scanning probe microscopy on surface enable not only direct observation of molecular structures but also local probe reactions, in which unstable short\u2010lived products have been synthesized and analyzed.

The structures of the precursor, two intermediates, and the final product were directly identified by the differential conductance imaging with a CO functionalized tip. DFT calculations revealed that the multiple\u2010step reaction, being endergonic overall, is facilitated by temporal charging and discharging of the molecule placed in the nanometric junction between the Cu tip and the Cu substrate underneath the ultra\u2010thin NaCl film. This local probe reaction expands possibilities to synthesize nanocarbon materials in a bottom\u2010up manner. },

The impact of metal\u2010to\u2010ligand charge transfer towards the redox noninnocence of 2,2\u2032\u2010azobis(benzothiazole) (abbt) has been highlighted on coordination to {Ru II (acac) 2 } (acac=2,4\u2010pentanedionato). It led to the authentication of a series of mononuclear and dinuclear complexes incorporating variable oxidation states of abbt (abbt 0\/.\u2212\/2\u2212 ). Mononuclear  1  was identified as [Ru III (abbt .\u2212 )], a MLCT excited state of [Ru II (abbt)]. Dinuclear  2  was however recognized as two discrete redox isomers: (i) radical bridged mixed\u2010valent meso\u2010[Ru 2.5 (\u03bc\u2010abbt .\u2212 )Ru 2.5 ] ( 2a ) and (ii) dianionic ligand bridged isovalent meso\u2010[Ru III (\u03bc\u2010abbt 2\u2212 )Ru III ] ( 2b ), demonstrating unprecedented structural confirmation of valence tautomerism in azo\u2010based ligand systems.

Polymerization at the liquid\u2013liquid interface has attracted much attention for synthesizing ultrathin polymer films for molecular sieving. However, it remains a major challenge to conduct this process outside the alkane\u2013water interface since it not only suffers water\u2010caused side reactions but also is limited to water\u2010soluble monomers. Here, we report the interfacial polymerization at the alkane\/ionic liquid interface (IP@AILI) where the ionic liquid acts as the universal solvent for diversified amines to synthesize task\u2010specific polyamide nanofilms. We propose that IP@AILI occurs when acyl chloride diffuses from the alkane into the ionic liquid instead of being triggered by the diffusion of amines as in the conventional alkane\u2013water system, which is demonstrated by thermodynamic partitioning and kinetic monitoring. The prepared polyamide nanofilms with precisely adjustable pore sizes display unprecedented permeability and selectivity in various separation processes. },

The interaction between electron spin and oxygen molecules in non\u2010platinum catalysts, particularly carbon catalysts, significantly influences the catalytic performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A promising approach to developing high\u2010performance catalysts involves introducing five\u2010membered ring structures with spin into graphitic carbons. In this study, we present the successful synthesis of cage\u2010like cubic carbon catalysts enriched with pentagon structures using pentagon ring\u2010containing C 60  and a NaCl template. The number of pentagons contained in the structure was increased by doping with nitrogen and annealing, and the number of electron spins also increased, thereby improving catalytic activity. The prepared catalyst exhibits remarkable activity in ORR under acidic electrolytes. Furthermore, we elucidate the correlation between the pentagon structure, the number of spin, and catalytic activity, demonstrating that enhanced activity is contingent upon the presence of spin. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the role of spin in improving activity. The concept of spin and the introduction of pentagon structures provide new design principles for carbon catalysts. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
Supramolecular chemistry is the chemistry of the intermolecular bond, covering the structures and functions of the entities formed by association of two or more chemical species. Molecular recognition in the supermolecules formed by receptor\u2010substrate binding rests on the principles of molecular complementarity, as found in spherical and tetrahedral recognition, linear recognition by coreceptors, metalloreceptors, amphiphilic receptors, and anion coordination. Supramolecular catalysis by receptors bearing reactive groups effects bond cleavage reactions as well as synthetic bond formation via cocatalysis. Lipophilic receptor molecules act as selective carriers for various substrates and make it possible to set up coupled transport processes linked to electron and proton gradients or to light. Whereas endoreceptors bind substrates in molecular cavities by convergent interactions, exoreceptors rely on interactions between the surfaces of the receptor and the substrate; thus new types of receptors, such as the metallonucleates, may be designed. In combination with polymolecular assemblies, receptors, carriers, and catalysts may lead to molecular and supramolecular devices, defined as structurally organized and functionally integrated chemical systems built on supramolecular architectures. Their recognition, transfer, and transformation features are analyzed specifically from the point of view of molecular devices that would operate via photons, electrons, or ions, thus defining fields of molecular photonics, electronics, and ionics. Introduction of photosensitive groups yields photoactive receptors for the design of light\u2010conversion and charge\u2010separation centers. Redox\u2010active polyolefinic chains represent molecular wires for electron transfer through membranes. Tubular mesophases formed by stacking of suitable macrocyclic receptors may lead to ion channels. Molecular self\u2010assembling occurs with acyclic ligands that form complexes of double\u2010helical structure. Such developments in molecular and supramolecular design and engineering open perspectives towards the realization of molecular photonic, electronic, and ionic devices that would perform highly selective recognition, reaction, and transfer operations for signal and information processing at the molecular level. },

Herein, a large\u2010area (square millimeters) and free\u2010standing 2D supramolecular polymer (2DSP) single\u2010layer sheet (0.7\u20130.9\u2005nm in thickness), comprising triphenylene\u2010fused nickel bis(dithiolene) complexes has been readily prepared by using the Langmuir\u2013Blodgett method. Such 2DSPs exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activities for hydrogen generation from water with a Tafel slope of 80.5\u2005mV\u2009decade \u22121  and an overpotential of 333\u2005mV at 10\u2005mA\u2009cm \u22122 , which are superior to that of recently reported carbon nanotube supported molecular catalysts and heteroatom\u2010doped graphene catalysts. This work is promising for the development of novel free\u2010standing organic 2D materials for energy technologies. },

A two\u2010dimensional covalent organic monolayer was synthesized from simple aromatic triamine and dialdehyde building blocks by dynamic imine chemistry at the air\/water interface (Langmuir\u2013Blodgett method). The obtained monolayer was characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy, which unambiguously confirmed the formation of a large (millimeter range), unimolecularly thin aromatic polyimine sheet. The imine\u2010linked chemical structure of the obtained monolayer was characterized by tip\u2010enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and the peak assignment was supported by spectra simulated by density functional theory. Given the modular nature and broad substrate scope of imine formation, the work reported herein opens up many new possibilities for the synthesis of customizable 2D polymers and systematic studies of their structure\u2013property relationships. },

To a large extent, the field of \u201cmolecular machines\u201d started after several groups were able to prepare, reasonably easily, interlocking ring compounds (named catenanes for compounds consisting of interlocking rings and rotaxanes for rings threaded by molecular filaments or axes). Important families of molecular machines not belonging to the interlocking world were also designed, prepared, and studied but, for most of them, their elaboration was more recent than that of catenanes or rotaxanes. Since the creation of interlocking ring molecules is so important in relation to the molecular machinery area, we will start with this aspect of our work. The second part will naturally be devoted to the dynamic properties of such systems and to the compounds for which motions can be directed in a controlled manner from the outside, that is, molecular machines. We will restrict our discussion to a very limited number of examples which we consider as particularly representative of the field. },

Methodology that enables the controlled synthesis of linear and branched polymers from an identical monomer will be a novel pathway for polymer synthesis and processing.

In a second approach, an identical monomer containing two carbazolyls is polymerized using chemical and electrochemical oxidizers, leading to topologically controllable growth of linear polymers in weak oxidizer or of cross\u2010linked polymer chains in strong oxidizer, with satisfactory long chain propagation of step growth polymerization ( M  n =6.0\u00d710 4 \u2005g\u2009mol \u22121 ,  M  w \/ M  n =2.3).

Synthesis of free\u2010standing two\u2010dimensional (2D) conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) films linked by C\u2212C bonds is highly desirable. Now a very simple and mild strategy has been developed to synthesize them by Suzuki polymerization on a water\u2013toluene interface in a refrigerator. The versatility of this strategy was confirmed by the successful synthesis of two different 2D\u2010COF films: a porous graphene and a porphyrin\u2010contained 2D\u2010COF. Both 2D\u2010COF films have large lateral size and their crystalline domains were visualized by high resolution TEM. Based on the wide compatibility of Suzuki reaction, our breakthrough work opened a door for the synthesis of various 2D conjugated COF films. For application studies, the porous graphene exhibits a good carrier mobility, which is much higher than \u2212C=N\u2212 linked 2D COF films and a good catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction, which is comparable with nitrogen\u2010 or phosphorus\u2010doped graphene. },

Incorporation of non\u2010equilibrium actions in the sequence of self\u2010assembly processes would be an effective means to establish bio\u2010like high functionality hierarchical assemblies. As a novel methodology beyond self\u2010assembly, nanoarchitectonics, which has as its aim the fabrication of functional materials systems from nanoscopic units through the methodological fusion of nanotechnology with other scientific disciplines including organic synthesis, supramolecular chemistry, microfabrication, and bio\u2010process, has been applied to this strategy. The application of non\u2010equilibrium factors to conventional self\u2010assembly processes is discussed on the basis of examples of directed assembly, Langmuir\u2013Blodgett assembly, and layer\u2010by\u2010layer assembly. In particular, examples of the fabrication of hierarchical functional structures using bio\u2010active components such as proteins or by the combination of bio\u2010components and two\u2010dimensional nanomaterials, are described.

Three\u2010dimensional ordered porous materials known as inverse opal films (IOFs) were synthesized using nanocrystals with precisely defined morphologies. Comprehensive theoretical and experimental studies of the volume fraction ratio and electrostatic interactions between nanocrystals and polystyrene templating particles enabled the formation of highly ordered crack\u2010free photonic structures. The synthetic strategy was first demonstrated using titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) nanocrystals of different shapes and then generalized to assemble nanocrystals of other functional materials, such as indium tin oxide and zinc\u2010doped ferrite. Tunable photocatalytic activity of the TiO 2  IOFs, modulated through the choice of the shape of TiO 2  nanocrystals in conjunction with selecting desired macroscopic features of the IOF, was further explored. In particular, enhanced activity is observed for crack\u2010free, highly ordered IOFs whose photonic properties can improve light absorption via the slow light effect. This study opens new opportunities in designing multi\u2010length\u2010scale porous nanoarchitectures having enhanced performance in a variety of applications. },

Molecular motors are fascinating nanomachines. However, constructing smart materials from such functional molecules presents a severe challenge in material science. Here, we present a bottom\u2010up layer\u2010by\u2010layer assembly of oriented overcrowded\u2010alkene molecular motors forming a crystalline metal\u2013organic framework thin film. While all stator parts of the overcrowded\u2010alkene motors are oriented perpendicular to the substrate, the rotors point into the pores, which are large enough allowing for the light\u2010induced molecular rotation. Taking advantage of the thin film's transparency, the motor rotation and its activation energy are determined by UV\/Vis spectroscopy. As shown by gravimetric uptake experiments, molecular motors in crystalline porous materials are used, for the first time, to control the adsorption and diffusion properties of guest molecules in the pores, here, by switching with light between the (meta\u2010)stable states. The work demonstrates the potential of designed materials with molecular motors and indicates a path for the future development of smart materials. },

The unfolding of the cage leading to the generation of imine intermediates, followed by their interface\u2010assisted preorganization and subsequent growth of the COF film, are elucidated through detailed spectroscopic and microscopic investigations. The interfacial cage\u2010to\u2010COF transformation provides a facile route for the faster fabrication of free\u2010standing COF films with high porosity and crystallinity, demonstrating excellent performance towards molecular sieving and high solvent permeance. Thus, the current study opens up a new route for structural interconversion between two crystalline entities with diverse dimensionality employing DCC at the confined interface. },

The character of the electronic structure of acenes has been the subject of longstanding discussion.

Here, we present the on\u2010surface synthesis of tridecacene molecules by thermal annealing of octahydrotridecacene on a Au(111) surface. We characterized the electronic structure of the tridecacene by scanning probe microscopy, which reveals the presence of an inelastic signal at 126\u2005meV. We attribute the inelastic signal to spin excitation from the singlet diradical ground state to the triplet excited state. To rationalize the experimental findings, we carried out many\u2010body ab initio calculations as well as model Hamiltonians to take into account the effect of the metallic substrate. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of how the dynamic electron correlation and virtual charge fluctuation between the molecule and metallic surface reduces the singlet\u2010triplet band gap. Thus, this work provides the first experimental confirmation of the magnetic character of tridecacene. },

This article reviews the basic principles of and recent developments in electrochromic, photochromic, and thermochromic materials for applications in smart windows. Compared with current static windows, smart windows can dynamically modulate the transmittance of solar irradiation based on weather conditions and personal preferences, thus simultaneously improving building energy efficiency and indoor human comfort. Although some smart windows are commercially available, their widespread implementation has not yet been realized. Recent advances in nanostructured materials provide new opportunities for next-generation smart window technology owing to their unique structure-property relations. Nanomaterials can provide enhanced coloration efficiency, faster switching kinetics, and longer lifetime. In addition, their compatibility with solution processing enables low-cost and high-throughput fabrication. This review also discusses the importance of dual-band modulation of visible and near-infrared (NIR) light, as nearly 50% of solar energy lies in the NIR region. Some latest results show that solution-processable nanostructured systems can selectively modulate the NIR light without affecting the visible transmittance, thus reducing energy consumption by air conditioning, heating, and artificial lighting. },

 When a two-dimensional (2D) film is compressed to its stability limit, it explores the third dimension via collapse. Understanding this 2D-to-3D transition is of great importance as it provides insight into the origin of defects in thin films. This review draws attention to a reversible folding collapse first discovered in model lung surfactant systems and explores the driving forces for this mechanism. The mode of collapse can be tuned by varying the mechanical properties of the film. I present a continuum elastic theory that captures the onset of the observed folding instability and use digital image analysis to analyze the folding dynamics. This article further explores factors that determine the maximum surface pressure a mixed monolayer can sustain and explains the observed phenomenon using the principle of rigidity percolation. The folding transition observed in lipid monolayers described here has also been observed in other systems, including monolayers of nanoparticles.  },

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) and acne are among the most common skin conditions in primary care. SSTIs caused by ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter sp.) can range in severity, and treating them is becoming increasingly challenging due to the growing number of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. There is also a rise in antibiotic-resistant strains of Cutibacterium acne, which plays a role in the development of acne. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered to be a promising solution to the challenges posed by antibiotic resistance. In this study, six new AMPs were rationally designed and compared to five existing peptides. The MIC values against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. faecium, S. aureus, and C. acnes were determined, and the peptides were evaluated for cytotoxicity using Balb\/c 3T3 cells and dermal fibroblasts, as well as for hemolytic activity. The interaction with bacterial membranes and the effect on TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 secretion were also evaluated for selected peptides. Of the tested peptides, RP556 showed high broad-spectrum antibacterial activity without inducing cytotoxicity or hemolysis, and it stimulated the production of IL-10 in LPS-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Four of the novel AMPs showed pronounced specificity against C. acnes, with MIC values (0.3\u20130.5 \u03bcg\/mL) below the concentrations that were cytotoxic or hemolytic. },

The search for new antimicrobial strategies is of major importance since there is a growing resistance of both bacteria and fungi to existing antimicrobials. Lipopeptides are promising and potent antimicrobial compounds. For translation into clinically useful molecules, effectiveness of peptide treatment against human infections must be proved in complex in vitro wound models. The aim of this study was to examine if the synthesized short lipopeptides (C10)2-KKKK-NH2 and (C12)2-KKKK-NH2 can protect HaCaT keratinocytes from bacterial damage caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection in a coculture model. After 1 h, 24 h, and 48 h incubation, cellular ATP level and release of the cytotoxicity marker LDH as well as the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and interleukin-1\u03b1 were measured. Infection of the keratinocytes resulted in strong bacterial damage of HaCaT cells along with low cellular ATP levels and high release of LDH, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b1 after 24 h and 48 h. Incubation of the infected human keratinocytes with (C10)2-KKKK-NH2 and (C12)2-KKKK-NH2 resulted in protection of the keratinocytes from bacterial damage caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection with ATP, LDH, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b1 levels comparable to the untreated control. Hence, both synthesized lipopeptides are promising candidates with high therapeutic potential in dermatology for the treatment of topical infections. },

Functional amphiphilic molecules which form liquid crystalline (l.c.) phases in aqueous solutions, can be polymerized to amphiphilic side chain polymers. Depending on the formation of the polymer backbone via the hydrophobic (type A) or hydrophilic part (type B) of the monomer, it can be differentiated between two polymers. For both types of polymers a model is proposed which explains their micellar association in solution. In aqueous solutions polymers of type A should form normal spherical, rodlike and disc\u2010like micelles, while polymers of type B should form the corresponding reversed micelles. 
The phase behavior in aqueous solutions is investigated with two model systems of monomer\/side chain polymer of type A. It is shown that the polymers exhibit l.c. phases, which are stable within a broader concentration range, as well as to higher temperatures compared to the corresponding monomers. The structures of the l.c. phases are in accordance with the model considerations. },

Nano\/micro polystyrene (PS) beads have found many applications in different fields spanning from drug delivery, bio-diagnostics, and hybrid plasmonics to advanced photonics. The sizes of the PS beads are an important parameter, especially in plasmonic and photonic experiments. In this work, we demonstrate a quick and straightforward method to estimate the diameters of sub-microspheres (0.2 \u03bcm to 0.8 \u03bcm) using the transmission spectra of a close-packed monolayer of polystyrene beads on glass or quartz substrates. Experimental transmission spectra of the PS monolayers were verified against finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation and showed good agreement. The effects of the substrates on the transmission spectra and, hence, the accuracy of the method were also studied by simulation, which showed that common transparent substrates only cause minor deviation of the PS bead sizes calculated by the proposed method. },

The societal impact of the electronics industry is enormous\u2014not to mention how this industry impinges on the global economy. The foreseen limits of the current technology\u2014technical, economic, and sustainability issues\u2014open the door to the search for successor technologies. In this context, molecular electronics has emerged as a promising candidate that, at least in the short-term, will not likely replace our silicon-based electronics, but improve its performance through a nascent hybrid technology. Such technology will take advantage of both the small dimensions of the molecules and new functionalities resulting from the quantum effects that govern the properties at the molecular scale. An optimization of interface engineering and integration of molecules to form densely integrated individually addressable arrays of molecules are two crucial aspects in the molecular electronics field. These challenges should be met to establish the bridge between organic functional materials and hard electronics required for the incorporation of such hybrid technology in the market. In this review, the most advanced methods for fabricating large-area molecular electronic devices are presented, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Special emphasis is focused on bottom-up methodologies for the fabrication of well-ordered and tightly-packed monolayers onto the bottom electrode, followed by a description of the top-contact deposition methods so far used. },

Meibomian gland disease is associated with quantitative or qualitative deficiencies of meibum (MGS) that result in tear film instability. Thus, there is great demand for ophthalmic nanoemulsions that can replenish MGS and recover its performance at the air\/tear surface. Rohto Dry Aid (RDA) utilizes TEARSHIELD TECHNOLOGYTM implementing a complex oil phase of non-polar and polar lipid-like molecules. Therefore, the interactions of RDA with MGS surface films deserve further study as they may provide valuable insights (i) into the mechanisms behind the nanoemulsion therapeutic action and (ii) for the design of novel ophthalmic formulations. Pseudobinary meibum\/RDA films were formed at the air\u2013water surface of the Langmuir trough. Surface pressure-area isocycles and stress relaxations were employed to probe the layer (i) reorganization upon cycling and (ii) dilatational elasticity, respectively. Film morphology was accessed by Brewster angle microscopy and the spreading properties of RDA-supplemented meibum were also probed. The diverse ingredients of the nanoemulsion oil phase complemented the non-polar and polar lipid constituents of the meibomian layers, which resulted in enhanced continuity of the MGS duplex film structure and facilitated the MGS spread and viscoelasticity. Nanoemulsions deserve further study as a potent tool for MGS-oriented therapy for dry eyes. },

Solution-processed CdTe nanocrystals (NCs) photovoltaic devices have many advantages, both in commercial manufacture and daily operation, due to the low-cost fabrication process, which becomes a competitive candidate for next-generation solar cells. All solution-processed CdTe NCs solar cells were first reported in 2005. In recent years, they have increased over four-fold in power conversion efficiency. The latest devices achieve AM 1.5 G power conversion efficiency up to 12.0%, values comparable to those of commercial thin film CdTe\/CdS solar cells fabricated by the close-space sublimation (CSS) method. Here we review the progress and prospects in this field, focusing on new insights into CdTe NCs synthesized, device fabrication, NC solar cell operation, and how these findings give guidance on optimizing solar cell performance. },

 Nanochemical printmaking : Colloidal lithography paves a powerful nanochemical way for patterning on planar substrates and microparticles. The feature size can easily be scaled down to 100\u2005nm by reducing the diameter of the microspheres and the feature shape diversified by the crystalline structure of a colloidal crystal mask, the mask etching time, the incidence angle of the vapor beam, and the mask registry (the azimuth angle of the vapor beam).   magnified image

The feature size can easily shrink by decreasing the microsphere diameter in the colloidal mask.

In situ fluorescence (FL), which is related to the internal motion and orientation, of three different FLAPs were investigated at the interface, and the internal motion of the molecule was indicated to be suppressed at the interface. In addition, the molecular response was compared with that of conventional viscosity probes (molecular rotors), which indicates the different behaviors of FLAP probably due to the distinct molecular orientation as well as molecular motion. },

Light\u2010sensitizer functionalized organic\u2013inorganic hybrid materials have attracted much attention owing to their potential applications in the fields of optoelectronics, heterogeneous catalysis, sensors, and nanotechnology. Here, an interfacial self\u2010assembly of zero\u2010dimensional (0D) silica@multiporphyrin array nanohybrids and their 3D Langmuir\u2013Blodgett (LB) films is reported. Photoactive tetrapyridylporphyrin (TPyP) was first assembled on the silica nanoparticles\u2019 surfaces via silane, substitution, and coordination reactions to produce nanoSiO 2 @(Pd\u2010TPyP)  n   hybrids. Then, the Cd 2+ \u2010nanoSiO 2 @(Pd\u2010TPyP)  n   monolayers and LB films were constructed on the CdCl 2  subphase surface. These monolayers and LB films displayed stronger stability, as well as more uniform and closely packed nanoparticle arrays compared with those prepared on the pure water surface, owing to the formation of strong network\u2010like Pd\u2010 and Cd\u2010TPyP coordination units, which significantly enhanced the nanoparticles\u2019 interaction. Further, compared with that of the 0D nanoSiO 2 @(Pd\u2010TPyP)  n   hybrids, the degradation efficiency was nearly 20\u2005times higher when the hybrids\u2019 LB films were used as light\u2010sensitizers for the photocatalytic degradation of RhB. Finally, flexible photochromic devices were constructed by using the LB films sandwiched between two electrodes, which displayed a reversible photoinduced redox reaction of viologen together with a color change process. Because TPyP was strongly immobilized on the nanoparticles\u2019 surfaces and the particles were connected through the Py\u2010Pd 2+ \u2010Py and Py\u2010Cd 2+ \u2010Py coordination units with the 3D network\u2010like architecture, the present nanohybrids and LB films had good stability and reusability. },

Molecular functions depend on conformations and motions of the corresponding molecular species. An air\u2013water interface is a suitable asymmetric field for the control of molecular conformations and motions under a small applied force. In this work, double\u2010paddled binuclear Pt II  complexes containing pyrazole rings linked by alkyl spacers were synthesized and their orientations and emission properties dynamically manipulated at the air\u2013water interface. The complexes emerge from water with concurrent variation of interface orientation of the planes of the Pt II  complexes from perpendicular to parallel during mechanical compression suggesting a unique \u2018submarine emission\u2018. Phosphorescence of the complexes is quenched at the air\u2013water interface prior to monolayer formation with intensities subsequently rapidly increasing during monolayer compression.

 abstract = { Abstract 
Functional materials with rational organization cannot be directly created only by nanotechnology\u2010related top\u2010down approaches. For this purpose, a novel research paradigm next to nanotechnology has to be established to create functional materials on the basis of deep nanotechnology knowledge. This task can be assigned to an emerging concept, nanoarchitectonics. In the nanoarchitectonics approaches, functional materials are architected through combination of atom\/molecular manipulation, organic chemical synthesis, self\u2010assembly and related spontaneous processes, field\u2010applied assembly, micro\/nano fabrications, and bio\u2010related processes. In this short review article, nanoarchitectonics\u2010related approaches on materials fabrications and functions are exemplified from atom\u2010scale to living creature level. Based on their features, unsolved problems for future developments of the nanoarchitectonics concept are finally discussed. },

 abstract = { Abstract \n               
In this work we present spectrally resolved photon emission microscopy (SPEM) measurements originating from short-channel MOSFETs acquired through the backside of the silicon substrate. Two commonly used detectors have been chosen for the detection of electroluminescence (EL) in the visible and near-infrared spectral regime, namely Si-CCD and InGaAs. As the backside photon emission (PE) inspection is strongly influenced by the absorption of light in a substrate material, the SPEM experiments have been carried out through thinned silicon layers as obtained by mechanical grinding and local focused-ion-beam (FIB) assisted Si material removal. Intrinsic Si absorption (generation of electron-hole pairs) and absorption on free carriers have been modeled to be able to calibrate experimental results and obtain devicerelated PE spectra. The results show no evidences of specific transitions and lead to a conclusion that photon emission from MOSFETs is fully electrical field related. },

A highly ordered carbon structure based on polyvinylidene chloride precursor has been developed to host silicon nanoparticles. The stoichiometric ratio of sacrificial H and Cl elements facilitated full utilization of the carbon content of the precursor that produced robust carbon coatings on silicon nanoparticles with excellent mechanic properties and electrochemical stabilities. The optimal sintering temperature and carbon content have been investigated. When evaluated as the anode of a lithium\u2010ion battery (LIB), the Si\u2009:\u2009C 1\u2009:\u20092 composite sintered at 800\u2009\u00b0C (SiC12\u2010800) provided excellent capacity retention of 85\u2009% at 0.1\u2005C after 50\u2005cycles with an enhanced CE, which reached 99\u2009% only after 10\u2005cycles. The SiC12\u2010800 electrode maintained a specific capacity of 709.2\u2005mAh\/g after 300\u2005cycles at 0.3\u2005C, and delivered a high rate performance of 737.9\u2005mAh\/g and 485.6\u2005mAh\/g at 5\u2005C and 10\u2005C, respectively. The results indicate that polymer precursors with stoichiometric ratio of sacrificial elements have high potential for generating highly robust carbon coatings for silicon anodes in high energy density LIBs. },

Designing nanoscale components and units into functional defined systems and materials has recently received attention as a nanoarchitectonics approach. In particular, exploration of nanoarchitectonics in two-dimensions (2D) has made great progress these days. Basically, 2D nanomaterials are a center of interest owing to the large surface areas suitable for a variety of surface active applications. The increasing demands for alternative energy generation have significantly promoted the rational design and fabrication of a variety of 2D nanomaterials since the discovery of graphene. In 2D nanomaterials, the charge carriers are confined along the thickness while being allowed to move along the plane. Owing to the large planar area, 2D nanomaterials are highly sensitive to external stimuli, a characteristic suitable for a variety of surface active applications including electrochemistry. Because of the unique structures and multifunctionalities, 2D nanomaterials have stimulated great interest in the field of energy conversion and storage. This review highlights recent progress in the synthesis of a variety of 2D nanomaterials and their applications in energy conversion and storage. Finally, opportunities and some critical challenges in these fields are addressed. },

In this review, we introduce two kinds of bio-related nanoarchitectonics, DNA nanoarchitectonics and cell-macromolecular nanoarchitectonics, both of which are basically controlled by chemical strategies. The former DNA-based approach would represent the precise nature of the nanoarchitectonics based on the strict or \u201cdigital\u201d molecular recognition between nucleic bases. This part includes functionalization of single DNAs by chemical means, modification of the main-chain or side-chain bases to achieve stronger DNA binding, DNA aptamers and DNAzymes. It also includes programmable assemblies of DNAs (DNA Origami) and their applications for delivery of drugs to target sites in vivo, sensing in vivo, and selective labeling of biomaterials in cells and in animals. In contrast to the digital molecular recognition between nucleic bases, cell membrane assemblies and their interaction with macromolecules are achieved through rather generic and \u201canalog\u201d interactions such as hydrophobic effects and electrostatic forces. This cell-macromolecular nanoarchitectonics is discussed in the latter part of this review. This part includes bottom-up and top-down approaches for constructing highly organized cell-architectures with macromolecules, for regulating cell adhesion pattern and their functions in two-dimension, for generating three-dimensional cell architectures on micro-patterned surfaces, and for building synthetic\/natural macromolecular modified hybrid biointerfaces. },

Combining nanotechnology with other science disciplines is necessary to produce various materials with nanoscale structural and functional information, which is nanoarchitectonics, a novel paradigm to create useful materials. One of the basic ideas in nanoarchitectonics is use of molecular-level information to structurally design functional materials. This strategy is indeed used in some existing science fields and technical realms. For example, molecular imprinting techniques provide functional materials possessing molecular information inside fabricated materials. Revisiting this idea with the nanoarchitectonics concept would have great meaning toward unification of individual research disciplines into one key approach. In this review, we survey fundamentals and recent trends in molecular imprinting in consideration of nanoarchitectonics. Here, aspects and examples of molecular imprinting are surveyed from fundamentals to advanced applications: (i) fundamental preparation of molecular imprinting polymers in the form of nanoparticles, nanofibers, thin films, and monolayers; (ii) surface coverage, post-modification, and introduction of new functional groups; (iii) imprinted materials with controllable guest binding by external stimuli such as photo-responsive, temperature-sensitive, pH-sensitive, solvent-dependent, and multi-stimuli responsive materials; (iv) imprinting using proteins as template and protein stamping; (v) use of cyclodextrins as functional monomers; (vi) advanced functions including highly sensitive and selective sensors combined with DNA aptamers and enzymatic reactions, post-imprinting for sophisticated sensors, and applications to drug delivery systems. },

Self-assembly is omnipresent in nature. While natural self-assembly systems are complicated in structure, the simplification of natural systems while maintaining their inherent functionalities has proven to be a highly promising route towards artificial nanoarchitectonics with great potential for application. In this review, we summarize our recent works on self-assembling peptide-based nanoarchitectonics, where peptides with a simple molecular structure can modulate the assembly of various species in a flexible and controllable way and efficiently construct nanoarchitectonics with desired functionalities. Our recent findings regarding the applications of self-assembling peptides in the fields of biomimetic photosystems, oriented microtubes for optical waveguiding, and phototherapy are discussed in detail. In addition, the self-assembly mechanism and the effects of peptides on self-assembly are reviewed. This review is expected to provide an understanding of the role of peptides in the assembly of nanoarchitectonics and guidance towards the future design and application of novel functional peptide-modulated self-assembling materials. },

In order to fabricate highly sophisticated nanostructures, various research fields must be fused into one unified concept. In recently emerging nanoarchitectonics, nanotechnology is combined with materials science, supramolecular self-assembly, and biological science to construct functional materials from nanoscale units. This review article focuses on dynamic features of nanoarchitectonics. In terms of this concept, molecular machines as one of the forefront research targets are produced from DNA and RNA. Fundamental designs of DNA\/RNA molecular machines are first described with an emphasis on the significant roles of interlocked structures such as rings, catenanes, rotaxanes, and connectors of these parts. In the latter part, DNA\/RNA molecular machines including shuttles, molecular transporters, walkers, nano pumps, robots, amplifiers, and logic gates are presented, together with related functions such as sensitive sensing and catalysis regulation. The exemplified strategy should be universally useful to fabricate various functional materials which fulfill social demands at the present as well as in the future. },

Incorporating soft and dynamic elements into crystalline porous materials with hard and static structures can be of immense utility. To this end, herein, the design of functional porous materials and their dynamic properties are described. Dynamic molecular elements were incorporated in porous coordination polymers (PCPs)\/metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to realize responsive and high-performance porous systems. The dynamic nature of the PCPs\/MOFs was directly visualized in real-time via atomic-force microscopy. Additionally, by combining the concepts of soft matter dynamics and porous material chemistry, a new class of porous materials, possessing both fluidity and porosity, could be fabricated.

Surface pressure versus molecular area (\u03c0-A) curves were measured on pure water as a subphase for a series of N,N\u2032-diperfluoroalkanoyl-1,2(R,R)-diaminocyclohexanes. A molecule is denoted as RR-CFn, where n is the number of carbon atoms in a perfluoroalkanoyl chain (or n \u2212 2 = the number of difluoromethylene units). The chain length was varied for n = 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. The results for n = 7 were reported previously. The effects of chain length and optical purity on film formation were investigated. The surface morphology of a film deposited onto a hydrophilic glass plate was observed using an atomic force microscope (AFM). For n = 4, 5, and 6, the floating films were already multilayered before compression and the deposited films were composed of rectangular or rod-like aggregates. For n = 7, 8, 9, and 10, monolayered films were formed and underwent structural transformation upon compression. From the AFM images, the films deposited after the transformation were composed of fiber-like aggregates. For a racemic mixture, no monolayer film was formed, and the film transfer was impossible irrespective of the chain length. p-Polarized infrared multiple angle incidence resolution spectrometry (pMAIRS) measurements were carried out on a film of RR-CF8 deposited onto a silicon wafer to determine the orientation of the composite molecules. The results were compared with the monolayer behavior reported for a compound having a single perfluoroalkyl chain. The relation to their gelation behavior is also discussed. },

Multicomponent sepiolite\/magnetite\/Prussian blue (PB) were prepared following the nanoarchitectonics approach by incorporating PB pigment to sepiolite fibers previously assembled with magnetite, being later encapsulated within in situ formed calcium alginate beads. These composites were characterized by diverse physicochemical techniques, showing homogeneous dispersion of the assembled nanoparticles (NP) on the surface of sepiolite fibers, the formed Ca-alginate beads exhibiting stability and superparamagnetic response. Based on the affinity of PB toward cesium ions, these beads were tested as selective adsorbent to remove Cs+ from water under different experimental conditions. The maximum adsorption capacity of the beads for Cs+ ions determined by Langmuir equation was around 130 mg\/g. The resulting beads maintain a constant adsorption capacity over a large domain of pH, i.e. from 4 to 11. The mechanism of Cs+ removal could be mainly ascribed to the complexing ability of PB, although in minor extent also to cation-exchange properties of sepiolite as well as to interactions with residual carboxylic groups from the alginate biopolymer matrix. The resulting multicomponent composite can be considered as an efficient, economic, ecologic and easily recoverable adsorbent for the removal of Cs+ ions from solution, including radioactive 137Cs, and therefore contributing to environmental remediation of pollution caused in nuclear plants. },

My research target can be described as \u201cNext Generation Multifunctional Nano-Science of Advanced Metal Complexes with Quantum Effect and Nonlinearity\u201d. My work encompasses four important key areas: (1) inorganic-organic hybrid systems, (2) nano-size and nano-space, (3) bottom-up and self-assembly, and (4) nonlinearity and quantum effect. Among them, nonlinearity and quantum effect are the most important for nano-science of advanced metal complexes. I have been working on these two topics (nonlinearity and quantum effect) simultaneously for more than 40 years. As for quantum effect, I have focused on Haldane gap systems, single-chain magnets (SCMs), single-molecule magnets (SMMs), Kondo resonance on SMMs, photo-switchable SMMs, metallic conducting SMMs, SMMs encapsulated into single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT), and metal-organic framework (MOF)-spintronics for spin qubits, for pursuing high-density memory devices and quantum computing. As for nonlinearity, I have focused on quasi-one-dimensional halogen-bridged metal complexes (MX-Chains; M = Pt, Pd, and Ni; X = Cl, Br, and I) with nonlinear excitons such as solitons and polarons, strongly electron-correlated Ni(III) complexes with gigantic third-order optical nonlinearity, and phase transitions and charge fluctuations between Pd(III) averaged states (= Mott insulator) and Pd(II)-Pd(IV) mixed-valence states (= charge density wave states), for pursuing optical communication, optical switching, and optical computing. In this review article, I will describe the above main topics (quantum effect and nonlinearity) according to my research history of more than 40 years, respectively. Finally, I will propose future perspectives for the two topics. },

Cytochrome (cyt) c is a multifunctional water-soluble heme protein. It transfers electrons from the cyt bc1 complex (Complex III) to cyt c oxidase (Complex IV) in the respiratory chain of mitochondria, and can trigger apoptosis as well. Although cyt c has been studied for more than a century, its new aspects are still being elucidated. For example, we found that cyt c molecules can form oligomers and polymers by 3D domain swapping (3D-DS), where the C-terminal \u03b1-helix is exchanged between molecules. 3D-DS is observed in other c-type cyts\u2014although the swapping regions may differ\u2014indicating that 3D-DS is a common feature for c-type cyts. 3D-DS of c-type cyt can occur during protein folding and expression in cells. The electron transfer ability of cyt c decreases by 3D-DS, due to the dissociation of Met80 from the heme iron, whereas the peroxidase activity increases. The cyt c electron transfer partners, Complex III and Complex IV, are embedded in the inner mitochondria membrane, whereas positively charged cyt c interacts with negatively charged cardiolipin (CL) molecules at the inner mitochondrial membrane. We have recently elucidated the CL-interaction site of cyt c at atomic level by NMR spectroscopy using CL-containing bicelles. The membrane interaction site of cyt c is relatively wide and similar to the interaction site for Complex III and Complex IV, indicating that cyt c interacts with lipid membranes and partner proteins in a similar way. When cyt c interacts strongly with CL, Met80 dissociates from the heme iron and the peroxidase activity of cyt c increases. We have shown that the proton concentration at the CL-containing membrane is higher than that in the bulk solution, which may enhance the peroxidase activity of cyt c. The Met80-dissociated cyt c has been shown to oxidize CL, increasing the permeability of cyt c through the membrane. We found that when Met80 is dissociated from the heme iron in cyt c, Met80 can be oxidized to methionine sulfoxide by the peroxidase reaction of the heme of cyt c or its reaction with molecular oxygen under reduced conditions. Met80-oxidized cyt c depicts a higher peroxidase activity compared to that of unmodified cyt c; thus Met80 oxidation may enhance lipid oxidation and eventually apoptosis. These new findings not only help in understanding the structure-function relationships of multifunctional cyt c but also show that there are still hidden properties in well-studied proteins. },

The molybdenum dioxo catalyst CNH\/MoO2 is prepared via direct grafting of (dme)MoO2Cl2 (dme = 1,2-dimethoxyethane) onto the graphitic surfaces of carbon nanohorn (CNH) substrates. The structure of this heterogeneous catalyst was characterized by SMART-EM, XPS, and ICP, and is found to have single isolated MoO2 species on the surface as well as a few multi-Mo species. The CNH\/MoO2 complex exhibits excellent catalytic activity for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrogenolysis, N-oxide reductions, and reductive carbonyl coupling, representing an informative model catalyst for structural and mechanistic investigations. },

Molecular crystals consist of an array of periodically arranged molecules in a three-dimensional space. Although nowadays we can routinely obtain crystal structures at the atomic level, the picture of how individual molecules gather together in an orderly manner and grow into crystals of visible size is still unresolved. Over the last decade, we focused on the mechanism of crystal nucleation, which is the initial step of crystallization\u2014it plays a critical role in determining the crystal structure. We investigated the self-assembly mechanism of crystal nuclei of organic crystals and metal\u2013organic frameworks using single-molecule-level electron microscopic imaging and bulk analysis. Statistical information on the size and structure of the individual prenucleation clusters, which cannot be investigated by conventional analytical methods, allowed us to study how the nucleating crystals acquire order and dimensionality in the nucleation process. We expanded understandings of the nucleation process to prepare submicrometer-sized amorphous particles of organic compounds from supersaturated solution by suppressing transition to crystalline nuclei, by external environment control. Further elucidation of the nucleation mechanism for various molecules will realize the controlled formation of crystals with desired structure and morphology, thus improving the efficiency of industrial processes, e.g., the production of pharmaceuticals and organic electronic devices. },

Organocatalysts activate substrates through mild noncovalent and covalent interactions, and their cooperative actions at multiple catalytic sites are essential even in intrinsically rapid organic reactions such as intramolecular cyclizations. The enzyme-like catalytic system is effective for recognizing specific molecular conformations of substrates, which continually change under reaction conditions, through multipoint interactions, thereby leading to high stereoselectivity. On the basis of this concept, we developed a range of organocatalytic asymmetric synthetic reactions, which are challenging using other categories of catalysts. The proposed catalysis was applied to various manners of asymmetric induction including those accompanied by not only facial selectivity but also by kinetic resolution (KR), dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR), desymmetrization, and dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT). They enabled various asymmetric transformations through intramolecular hetero-Michael addition, construction of axial chirality, and \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated acylammonium catalysis, which advanced the methods for asymmetric heterocycle synthesis, construction of tetrasubstituted chiral carbons, enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral compounds, and asymmetric library synthesis of pharmaceutically potential compounds. This study also expanded the chemistry of bifunctional organocatalysis. This review provides a comprehensive account of our achievements regarding multipoint recognition of molecular conformations with organocatalysts for asymmetric synthetic reactions. },

Calibration curves are essential constructs in analytical chemistry to determine parameters of sensing performance. In the classification of sensing data of complex samples without a clear dependence on a given analyte, however, establishing a calibration curve is not possible. In this paper we introduce the concept of a multidimensional calibration space, which could serve as reference to classify any unknown sample as in determining an analyte concentration from a calibration curve. This calibration space is defined from a set of rules generated using a machine learning method based on trees applied to the dataset. The number of attributes employed in the rules defines the dimension of the calibration space and is established to warrant full coverage of the dataset. We demonstrate the calibration space concept with impedance spectroscopy data from sensors, biosensors and an e-tongue, but the concept can be extended to any type of sensing data and classification task. Using the calibration space should allow for the correct classification of unknown samples, provided that the data used to generate rules via machine learning can cover the whole range of sensing measurements. Furthermore, an inspection in the rules can assist in the design of sensing systems for optimized performance. },

Nanoarchitectonics is a concept envisioned to produce functional materials from nanoscale units through fusion of nanotechnology with other scientific disciplines. For component selection, coordination complexes with metallic elements have a wider variety of element selection because metallic elements cover ca. 80% of the periodic table of the elements. Application of nanoarchitectonics approaches to coordination chemistry leads to huge expansion of this concept to a much wider range of elements. Especially, coordination asymmetry strategy architects asymmetrical and\/or chiral structures and\/or electronic states through formation of metal coordination complexes, leading to functional material systems in certain anisotropy and selectivity. This review article presents expansion of the nanoarchitectonics concept to coordination asymmetry through collecting recent examples in the field of coordination asymmetry. Introduced examples are classified into several categories from various viewpoints: (i) basic molecular and material designs; (ii) specific features depending on interfacial media, space and contact with bio-functions; (iii) functions; (iv) supporting techniques such as analyses and theory. },

The diverse topological structure, designable building blocks, ordered pores and crystalline architecture of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) make them attractive in many application fields. However, COF materials obtained by solvothermal synthesis are generally poorly soluble powders and difficult to post-process, which may impede some applications of COFs. The direct preparation of COF films is effective to overcome the limitations of poor solubility of COFs. This article reviews the synthesis of COF films at interfaces and the applications of COF films. At first, the synthesis strategies for preparing monolayer COF with large crystalline domains on solid substrates are introduced. Then we discuss interface synthesis methods, including solid-liquid, liquid-liquid and liquid-gas interface, for various COF films. Subsequently, the applications of COF film in many fields such as photoelectric conversion, fluorescence, electronic devices, chemical sensing, electrocatalysis, and molecular separation are introduced briefly. Finally, prospects for the interface synthesis and application expansion of COF films are discussed. },

Self-assembled macaroni fullerene C60 crystals (MFCs) of uniform shape and narrow size distribution are produced using the dynamic liquid-liquid interfacial precipitation method under ambient conditions. High temperature heat treatment (900 \u00b0C) of MFCs yields mesoporous carbons tubes (MCTs) retaining the initial morphology. This novel mesoporous carbon material exhibits excellent electrochemical supercapacitive performance due to high surface areas (1544 m2 g\u22121), large pore volume (2.936 cm3 g\u22121) and interconnected porous structures. In a three-electrode aqueous electrolyte system, the electrode achieved high specific capacitance ca. 422 F g\u22121 at a current density of 1 A g\u22121 followed by excellent cycling stability (&gt;95%) after 10,000 charging-discharging cycles at 20 A g\u22121.

Layer-by-Layer (LbL) assembly of interactive polymers onto surfaces leads to the construction of multilayered ultrathin films, which can be done simply by alternately dipping the substrate into various solutions. The range of applications of this LbL assembly can be broadened by introducing molecular recognition mechanisms for polymers and proteins, and by using weak interactions such as van der Waals interactions and biological recognition. As a specific example, it can be applied to the formation of stereocomplexes of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly-lactide (PLA), and fibronectin-collagen as extracellular matrix proteins. In weakly interacting LbL assemblies, the polymer chain tends to be placed in the most structurally stable state. This feature has been successfully used for template polymerization of stereoregular polymers, significant morphological control of biodegradable nanomaterials, and fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) cellular tissue constructs. LbL assembly based on weak interactions is expected to further stimulate interest in the interdisciplinary fields of bioscience and polymer chemistry. Using LbL technology to create functional 3D tissues, such as skin models (LbL-3D Skin) and heart models (LbL-3D Heart), will be a breakthrough in science and technology. },

Application of data-scientific approaches to conventional sciences, such as chemo-informatics, bio-informatics, and materials informatics (MI), has attracted much interest toward data-driven research. The concept enables accelerated discovery of new materials, enhancement of performance, and optimization of processes. However, sufficient bigdata is not always prepared to apply to machine learning. For example, experimental scientists have their own small data including success and failure in their laboratory, whether in academia or industry. If such small data is effectively utilized with a data-scientific approach, research activities can be accelerated without energy, resource, and cost consumption. This account focuses on MI for small data, a recent concept for application of small data, with introduction of model cases, such as control of exfoliation processes to obtain 2D materials. Combination of machine learning and chemical perspective is effective for construction of straightforward and interpretable predictors through the extraction of a limited number of descriptors from small dataset. Although the prediction accuracy is not so precise, the model has enough accuracy to be a guideline reducing the number of the next experiments. The present MI for small data opens potentials of small-data-driven chemistry and materials science. },

Multi-dimensional coordination frameworks whose charge states are controllable by the sophisticated chemical modification of the components or by the application of stimuli are fascinating targets for the design of electronic\/magnetic functional materials. A simple way to design such frameworks is to assemble electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) units in a DmAn ratio with electronically conjugated linkages; we call this type of framework a D\/A metal\u2013organic framework (D\/A-MOF). In this account article, our previous studies on D\/A-MOFs composed of carboxylate-bridged paddlewheel-type diruthenium units ([Ru2]) and polycyano organic molecules such as N,N\u2032-dicyanoquinodiimine (DCNQI) and 7,7,8,8-tetracyano-p-quinodimethane (TCNQ) as the D and A subunits, respectively, are summarized. In this family of D\/A-MOFs, the charge distribution between the internal D and A subunits can be precisely tuned by varying their electronic structure, i.e., depending on what kind of D and A we choose. Crucially, the diverse charge states, as well as anisotropic framework and often porous nature, of D\/A-MOFs are well correlated with their bulk electronic and magnetic properties. },

Despite being generated from the same element and having some of the properties commonly shared, each type of carbon allotrope possessing divergent shape confers unique and distinguishable physicochemical properties, thereby making them attractive for a wide range of potential applications. Moreover, research progress has allowed for further tailoring the properties in a controlled way to design more fascinating and aesthetically pleasing architectures with outstanding materials properties. In fact, some chemically modified carbon allotropes and their products have shown significant promise to solve a number of major issues in polymer exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and supercapacitors (SCs) such as efficient low Pt loaded oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, carbon allotrope-based proton conductors for PEMFC electrolyte, carbon monoxide (CO) tolerant anode catalysts for PEMFC, and carbon allotropes-based SC electrodes. The tremendous progress made in carbon-based materials facilitates those technologies more realistically towards large-scale implementation in terms of increasing the stack power density and reducing cost. In this view, this review will provide a thorough insight for researchers into the use of carbon allotropes and relevant products for PEMFCs and SCs. },

Current greenhouse gas emissions suggest that keeping global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees, as espoused in the Paris Agreements will be challenging, and to do so, the achievement of carbon neutrality is of utmost importance. It is also clear that no single solution can meet the carbon neutral challenge, so it is essential for scientific research to cover a broad range of technologies and initiatives which will enable the realization of a carbon free energy system. This study details the broad, yet targeted research themes being pioneered within the International Institute for Carbon-Neutral Energy Research (I2CNER). These approaches include hydrogen materials, bio-mimetic catalysts, electrochemistry, thermal energy and absorption, carbon capture, storage and management and refrigerants. Here we outline the state of the art for this suite of technologies and detail how their deployment, alongside prudent energy policy implementation can engender a carbon neutral Japan by 2050. Recognizing that just as no single technological solution will engender carbon neutrality, no single nation can expect to achieve this goal alone. This study represents a recognition of conducive international policy agendas and is representative of interdisciplinary, international collaboration. },

Recent progress in research of light-promoted surface morphing on polymer materials is reviewed. Photoinduced mass transport motions in azobenzene polymers leading to surface relief gratings (widely called SRGs) formation are well-known and extensively discussed. Among many efforts, this article focuses on unconventional approaches, most of which are seemingly less highlighted. The first part introduces investigations using azobenzene polymers; introducing supramolecular approaches with tunable and removable azobenzene units, self-structuring of surface morphology upon single laser beam irradiation, photo-triggered migration via Marangoni flow, SRG formation and other functions of polymer brushes etc. The second part overviews the mass transport motions driven by other photoreaction classes such as photopolymerization, photocrosslinking, and photoisomerization of non-azobenzene components. The final part describes new dynamic surface morphing processes observed in fingerprint texture of liquid crystals and liquid crystal polymer networks, which can be applied to reversible friction control and self-cleaning. These uncommon attempts at photo-assisted dynamic morphing extend the possibilities of microfabrication on polymer films and are expected to find new opportunities to create new surface functions in soft materials. },

Recently, we found that a bulky 2,6-diisopropylphenyl azide is more reactive than a simple phenyl azide toward acrolein. Herein, we conjugated tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) to the bulky phenyl azide and utilized it as a second-generation click-to-sense (CTS) probe to analyze cancer by targeting the cellular acrolein. Subsequently, we observed that this second-generation CTS probe could distinguish breast cancer tissues with higher sensitivity than the first-generation CTS probe. Moreover, adding Rh2(OAc)4 to the system promotes the formation of a metal carbenoid intermediate that accelerates the covalent attachment of the probe to an organelle in the cancer cells. },

Epsilon iron oxide (\u03b5-Fe2O3) is attracting global attention as a magnetic material with a large magnetic anisotropy. In this article, the optical properties of \u03b5-Fe2O3 nanoparticles and the metal-substituted series of \u03b5-MxFe2\u2212xO3 (M = Ga, In, and Al) are studied over a wide frequency range from the millimeter-wave to terahertz-wave region, 30 GHz\u201330 THz, using terahertz time-domain, far-infrared, and Raman spectroscopies. To understand the spectroscopic data, first-principles calculations of the electronic structure and phonon modes are performed. First, an \u03b5-Fe2O3 bar magnet is introduced and its atomic movements are calculated by phonon mode calculations. Second, the phonon modes of Ga-substituted \u03b5-Fe2O3 are calculated. Far-IR, mid-IR, and Raman spectroscopies confirm that the calculated and observed spectra show good agreement. Third, the influences of In-substitution on the crystal structure, magnetic properties, and millimeter-wave absorption are described. In high-frequency millimeter-wave absorption due to magnon, the resonance frequency decreased with In-substitution. Finally, the millimeter-wave absorption property of \u03b5-AlxFe2\u2212xO3 is described. An absorption peak due to the natural resonance occurs at 100 GHz. The rotation data of the transmitted millimeter wave are determined by millimeter-wave\u2013polarization-plane measurements. },

K-ion batteries (KIBs) are a widely attractive alternative to Li-ion batteries. While avoiding scarce\/toxic elements in their construction, the low standard electrode potential of K+\/K allows a low cut-off potential of the negative electrode and high operation voltages that are competitive with those observed in LIBs. Because of the wide operating potential range, developing improved non-aqueous electrolytes with higher oxidation stability and the ability to passivate low-potential negative electrodes is one of the major challenges of high-voltage KIB production. This account primarily covers our recent studies on non-aqueous electrolytes design based on potassium salt and solvent properties. We also discuss remaining\/emerging challenges and provide our perspective on non-aqueous electrolytes for high-voltage KIBs. },

Chiral supramolecular polymers were constructed through the host-guest complexation of an octaphosphonate biscavitand and a chiral diammonium guest. Isothermal titration calorimetry determined that host-guest complexation was enthalpy- and entropy-favored with high binding constants. Diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy and viscometry of the host-guest solution revealed that supramolecular polymerization occurred, which most likely followed a ring-chain mechanism. The cyclic oligomers and the supramolecular polymer chains were visualized by atomic force microscopy. Circular dichroism was observed when the octaphosphonate biscavitand and the chiral diammonium guest were mixed, which suggested that chirally twisted supramolecular polymers were formed. },

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small subpopulation of cells within the cancer tissue that play major roles in metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence. Synthetic ligands capable of recognizing the specific DNA sequences are believed to be promising in targeted disruption of transcription factor-DNA interaction, which can achieve regulatory control over tumor-susceptible signaling pathways. Herein, we report a sequence-specific cyclic pyrrole-imidazole polyamide capable of targeting Gli-mediated transcription and inhibiting the hedgehog pathway which is implied to play a major role in cancer stem cell proliferation. The DNA binding affinities of cyclic polyamides were superior to corresponding hairpin polyamides. Mechanistically, the cyclic PIPs blocked the Gli function, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR and luciferase assay. Furthermore, combinatorial treatment of cyclic PIPs and temozolomide (TMZ) to glioblastoma and brain cancer stem cells showed increased cell death compared to TMZ alone. Taken together, cyclic PIPs targeting Gli-mediated transcription can be a promising strategy in suppressing the CSCs. },

Promoted understanding of nanostructures and their functions significantly rely on rapid progress of nanotechnology within a few decades. It would be a fruitful way to consider materials science through regulation of nanostructure regulations on the basis of nanotechnological accomplishments. As a post-nanotechnology concept, a new concept of nanoarchitectonics has recently emerged as a methodology to produce functional materials from nanoscale units. In this review article, we discuss the recent advances of materials nanoarchitectonics and related approaches from atom-scales to living cell sizes. The approaches on multiscale nanoarchitectonics are exemplified and discussed including atom and molecules nanoarchitectonics, supramolecular nanoarchitectonics, and nanoarchitectonics at cell-scale. Next, supracell-level nanoarchitectonics is discussed including living cell organization at designed surfaces, cell sheets and layered nanoarchitectonics, three-dimensional cell nanoarchitectonics, biofilms and bioinks, and new challenges for living cells at liquid interface. All the materials are formed with fundamental units, atoms, molecules, and nanomaterials, and therefore, the nanoarchitectonics approaches from basic units to materials can be hypothetically applied to any kind of material. Therefore, nanoarchitectonics could be a method for everything in materials science as an analogy to a theory of everything in physics. },

We aim to establish the importance of molecular design for the formation of monolayers at an air-water interface within the concept \u201ccoordination amphiphile\u201d, which is based on ligand characteristics and molecular topology. For this purpose, five types of platinum complexes containing a coordination plane, including salicylaldiminato (SA) and \u03b2-(iminomethyl)azolato (IA) complexes, were prepared where the ligand characteristics were controlled. Polymethylene-vaulted and non-vaulted complexes were then examined to assess the effects of molecular topology on interfacial activity. SA complexes tend to undergo random aggregation at an air-water interface, while the weak hydrophilicity of SA can assist in the formation of a stable monolayer if hydrophobic and hydrophilic chains are introduced to the structure. In contrast, IA complexes exhibit topological specificity; imidazolato and pyrazolato complexes form monolayers only for non-vaulted and vaulted complex, respectively. Molecular modelling and association constants of the compounds suggest that an appropriate hydrophilicity of the coordination plane and intermolecular interactions involving hydrogen bonding are important factors for monolayer formation. },

The development of defect-containing metal-free carbon materials is an exciting challenge, as it could contribute greatly to the emergence of more sustainable fuel cells and metal\u2013air batteries.

Indeed, the formation of large sp2 domains and the nature of heteroatom catalytic active sites, ranging from a large content of pyridinic (N-6) to quaternary (N-Q) functionalities, could be simply controlled within a range of pyrolysis temperatures from 625 \u00b0C to 775 \u00b0C. The resulting ORR properties of carbon material exhibit systematic behaviour regarding the pyrolysis temperature, testifying good control upon carbon material nature. Thus, this work opens new ways to explore COF capabilities to efficiently synthesize metal-free carbon materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems. },

In this paper, we describe the chemical synthesis of a large artificial protein human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease (HIV-1 PR) analog with a 115-mer polypeptide chain on which some amide bonds in the main chain have been replaced by disulfide bonds. In this synthesis, a new 3-nitro-2-pyridine (Npy)-sulfenylation agent Npys-OPh(pF), which can form an active disulfide by reaction with a t-Bu protected cysteine residue, was found to be applicable to the efficient and sequential disulfide ligation producing disulfide polypeptides. Two sequential disulfide ligations in three peptide fragments were accomplished for the construction of an HIV-1 PR disulfide analog. In the Trp-containing fragment 2, mesitylenesulfonyl (Mts) protection avoided a side reaction of Npys-OPh(pF), probably at an indole residue. The HIV-1 PR disulfide analog was successfully synthesized from fragment 1 with an isolated yield of 11% by two disulfide ligations of the fragments and the final Mts deprotection of the Trp residue. },

The amount of CMF or cell number was varied to evaluate the relationship between tissue modulus and blood capillary length. Although varying the amount of CMF did not significantly affect these factors, the numbers of fibroblasts and endothelial cells indicated a huge impact on the modulus of tissues and the length of blood capillaries. These findings provide an important basic knowledge of blood capillary formation in 3D tissue in the field of 3D tissue engineering. },

For these three years, COVID-19 has globally spread and caused enormous damage all over the world. Although vaccines served to reduce its infection, their effects are still limited mainly due to rapid and vigorous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 virus. In order to bring this pandemic under control, we must develop novel medicines which are easily administered when needed and very effective without undesired side-effects. In this account, the developments of specific medicines for COVID-19 are surveyed with the emphasis on the molecular mechanisms of their therapeutic actions. Most of them are inhibitors of enzymes, which are indispensable for the virus, but unnecessary for human beings. These inhibitors selectively hamper the critical steps for viral proliferation (viral entry to human cells, replication of RNA genome, production of viral proteins, and others). There have been several successful examples, which are already approved as medicines for the treatment of COVID-19. Unfortunately, however, few of them sufficiently satisfy all the requirements to overcome this unprecedented pandemic completely, and thus further innovation is necessary. },

We report a molecular sensor, comprising a porphyrin core and four 2-aminoquinolyl groups at meso positions, for the naked-eye detection of glutaric acid and isophthalic acid, both featuring a C3 spacer between two CO2H groups. In the presence of the C3 dicarboxylic acids, solutions of the porphyrin sensor underwent significant changes in color and absorption spectra. NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography revealed that the porphyrin derivative bound to two molecules of the C3 dicarboxylic acids selectively to form 1:2 complexes, which dimerized through strong \u03c0-stacking interactions. Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the red-shifting of the Q-bands in the absorption spectra of the porphyrin derivative arose from tilted quinolyl rings in the dimeric complexes. In addition, we found that a test strip containing the porphyrin sensor could also be used to efficiently detect glutaric acid and isophthalic acid. },

To study the possibility of controlling molecular assemblies such as monolayers by using chirality, we synthesized 1-[1-(6-stearyl)pyrenyl]ethanol (SP6E), a novel amphiphilic molecule with a chiral center in the hydrophilic part and a pyrene ring in the long-chain alkyl backbone. The structures of racemic and optically active monolayers of SP6E were characterized using the \u03c0\u2013A isotherm and analyzed by Brewster angle microscopy, surface fluorescence spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results showed that (\u00b1)-SP6E formed solid solution-like monolayers without any regular structure. By contrast, a one-dimensional columnar structure was observed in the (S)-(\u2212)-SP6E monolayer by AFM, thereby confirming the formation of a relatively controlled monolayer structure. The successful structural control in (S)-(\u2212)-SP6E is considered achieved through the cooperative effects of chirality and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking of the pyrene ring. Thus, this study demonstrates the possibility of controlling the structure and orientation of molecular assemblies by appropriately combining chirality and other intermolecular interactions based on molecular design. This approach is a promising strategy for developing surface materials and interfacial nanoarchitectonics with precisely controlled molecular orientations. },

The exploration of molecular recognition in lipid bilayers is still extremely difficult. In this report, we leveraged short-range energy transfer (ET) that enabled detection of close contacts within 1 nm distance, and applied it to the interaction of natural products with sterols in lipid bilayers. Amphidinol 3 (AM3), a polyhydroxy\u2013polyene metabolite from a marine dinoflagellate, possesses potent antifungal activity by forming membrane pores in a sterol-dependent manner. Although AM3 was shown to interact directly with membrane sterols, the mode of interaction is yet to be fully elucidated. Herein, we found that AM3 and cholestatrienol (CTL), a fluorescent sterol, can be an ET pair because the emission spectrum of the former overlaps with the excitation of the latter. We further confirmed that CTL exerts the sterol-dependent pore formation of AM3 as in the case of cholesterol. Then, titration using intermolecular ET in bilayers revealed that AM3 and CTL form a 1:1 complex with a dissociation constant of 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22125 M. The distance between the AM3 polyene and CTL triene was estimated to be less than 1 nm. Based on this information, we proposed a tight binding model between AM3 and the sterol in lipid bilayers. },

Nanosheets of metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs)\u2014porous crystalline materials consisting of metal ions and organic ligands\u2014are actively studied for their intrinsic chemical\/physical properties attributed to the reduced dimensionality and for their potential to function as ideal components of nanodevices, especially when electrical conduction is present. Air\/liquid interfacial synthesis is a promising technique to obtain highly oriented MOF nanosheets. However, rational control of size and shape combined with the aimed functionality remains an important issue to address making it necessary to research the critical factors governing nanosheet characteristics in the interfacial synthesis. Here, we investigate the influence of the solvent\u2014methanol (MeOH) versus N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)\u2014used to prepare a ligand spread solution on an assembly of MOF nanosheets composed of Ni2+ and 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene (HITP) (HITP-Ni-NS). We find that the macroscopic morphological uniformity in the micrometer scale is higher when DMF is used as the solvent. Regarding the microscopic crystalline domain, molecules of DMF with relatively high polarity and boiling point are involved in HITP-Ni-NS formation, hindering its growth and resulting in nanosheets with slightly smaller lateral size than that grown when MeOH is used. These findings provide crucial guidelines towards establishing a judicious strategy for creating desired MOF nanosheets at the air\/liquid interface, thereby driving forward research on both fundamental and applied aspects of this field. },

In this study, we designed a new monolayer-forming material, 2, 2\u2032-bis(octadecyloxy)-1, 1\u2032-binaphthyl-6, 6\u2032-dicarboxylic acid (BNOC), which has axial chirality derived from the binaphthyl moiety with two COOH groups. Because the axial chirality of the binaphthyl group occupies a larger asymmetric space than the central chirality, the arrangement of the binaphthyl derivative is expected to show a characteristic structure at the air\u2013water interface. In addition, BNOC has two carboxyl groups, which may form intermolecular hydrogen bonds. We carried out the structural analyses of racemic and optically active BNOC monolayers using surface pressure\u2013area isotherms in parallel with Brewster angle microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our results indicated that (\u00b1)-BNOC forms a solid film while (S)-BNOC forms a liquid film. Moreover, AFM structural analysis revealed that the real lattices of both monolayers differ significantly. These structural differences are attributed to the steric regularity resulting from the axial chirality, which causes a difference in the mode of intermolecular interaction between the two monolayers. },

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) captivate tremendous interest thanks to high-efficiency and low-cost. Nevertheless, the planar PSCs are negatively affected by serious reflection loss usually because of the refractive index mismatch between the glass substrate and the air, which limits their light harvesting performance. Here, we report an investigation for highly efficient PSCs with light management by applying a structural antireflective film made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pyramidal texture. Machine learning is firstly used to predict planar (FAPbI3)0.95(MAPbBr2.2Cl0.8)0.05 PSC\u2019 performance for an experimental guide. The experimental results show excellent agreement between the two. When the antireflective film is utilized in the present planar PSCs, an impressive light absorption enhancement is achieved, resulting in a significantly increased power conversion efficiency of up to 23.5%. },

The reasonable regulation of porous structure and crystallinity has been focused on supercapacitor development. Here, hierarchical porous carbons have been prepared by a hybrid of chemical activation and template methods using walnut shells as carbon source, and KMnO4 as activator and template agent. The activation mechanism of KMnO4 at different activation temperatures has been studied based on the XRD and TG analysis. Due to the synergy of rich oxygen-containing functional groups and hierarchical porous structure, the hierarchical porous carbon materials show a high capacitance of 380 F g\u22121 at 0.5 A g\u22121, good cycling stability with 93% capacitance retention even after 10000 continuous charge-discharge cycles at 5 A g\u22121. Additionally, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor has a high energy density of 8.95 Wh kg\u22121. This study shows that KMnO4 activation is a mild and highly efficient way to prepare high performance carbon electrode materials for supercapacitors. },

Introducing electron-withdrawing imide and amide moieties lowers the HOMO energy levels of the polymers, resulting in an increase in the open-circuit voltages of OPVs. Complementary photoabsorption over the entire visible range was achieved by combining P(BDT-BTI) and P(BDT-BTA) with a typical non-fullerene acceptor, IT-4F.

The oxidative conversion of NADH to NAD+ is a key process for enzymatic biofuel cells to obtain high performance. To promote this conversion, we utilized a photogalvanic cell whose reactions involved the indirect oxidation of NADH mediated by photo-excited flavinmononucleotide (FMN) at the anode and electroreduction of H+ to produce H2 gas at the cathode. Based on the relationship between the passing charge and the concentration changes in NADH, NAD+, and FMN during the discharge, it was determined that the FMN-mediated oxidation of NADH quantitatively proceeded. The enzymatic biofuel cell was fabricated using this photogalvanic cell. By introducing both the ethanol biofuel and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to the photogalvanic cell, the cell current continued to flow because NAD+ was converted to NADH by the biofuel and the enzyme. This cell provided not only electricity, but also H2 gas as a by-product. This is an advantageous feature, which typical enzymatic fuel cells do not possess. },

In this review article, we focus on the design and creation of earth-abundant non-precious metal-coordinated eco-friendly catalysts with high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances. The development of a cost-effective, efficient and durable bifunctional ORR and OER electrochemical catalyst is a key for future batteries. So far, precious metals, such as Pt and Ir, have been used as efficient catalysts for the ORR and OER, respectively. However, they are expensive and their deposits on earth are limited, which are the major drawbacks of these metals. One more drawback for the practical application is the sluggish reactions of ORR and OER. Since electroconductivity of promising metal-free catalyst candidates are poor, good electronic supporting materials are needed. Owing to the high conductivity, stability and easy handling, carbon nanotubes are a most promising material. After Introduction, we summarize recent advances in i) carbon nanotube\/nanocarbon-based ORR and OER catalysts, ii) metal oxide and others\/nanocarbon catalysts for ORR, OER, HER and Zn-air electrodes, as well as iii) computational study for such catalyst reactions. Such studies are highly beneficial for future energy materials design and synthesis in batteries and molecular catalysts with high performances. },

Fluorine-free superhydrophobic surfaces have been required to meet environmental regulations in recent years. A new nanoarchitectonics is required to achieve superhydrophobicity without using perfluoroalkyl compounds. In the present work, surface-modified exfoliated nanosheets with polydispersed sizes were utilized to prepare coatings with high surface roughness and low surface energy. Fluorine-free superhydrophobic surfaces were obtained by spray coating of surface-modified exfoliated nanosheets based on transition-metal oxides. The water contact angle (\u03b8w) 166.0 \u00b1 0.5\u00b0 is the highest compared with that of the fluorine-free substrate-independent coatings in previous reports. The significant factors related to \u03b8w were studied using machine learning combined with our chemical insight in the small data obtained in the present work. The resultant superhydrophobic coatings exhibited unique properties, such as sliding of water droplets, superoleophilic behavior, recyclability, and durability.

Owing to their cost-effectiveness and renewability, wood-based solar steam generators (WSSG) have gained prominence in the field of desalination and water purification. However, conventional bi-layered WSSG is limited by the high energy consumption of fabrication and low strength of the bonding interface, which makes them unsuitable for long-term applications. Here, a unique bi-layered structural composite with polyaniline (PANI) nanorods uniformly incorporated into a 3D mesoporous matrix of natural wood was fabricated via a one-step in-situ polymerization strategy. The PANI decorated wood (PANI-wood) shows ultrahigh sunlight absorptance (\u223c98.9%) over a broad wavelength range (200\u20132500 nm) due to the conjugation of coralloid PANI nanorods and wood. Moreover, numerous aligned wood microchannels enable constant and rapid water transport at the air-water interface under the pressure of capillary forces. The highly stable PANI-wood composite shows high potential as an ideal solar steam generator with a high evaporation rate of 1.62 kg m2 h\u22121, which is significantly higher than those of other previously reported wood-based bi-layered composites. Moreover, PANI-wood exhibits long-term floating and is chemically stable, making it a potential candidate for low-energy photothermal interfacial sewage purification. },

This Award Account reports our recent studies concerning the catalytic transformations that involve a non-classical mode of molecular activation by tertiary phosphines and N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). Regarding organophosphine catalysis, we successfully designed reactions based on a P(III)\/P(V) redox couple. A catalytic protocol for generating pentacoordinate P(V) species was devised by the reaction of tertiary phosphines, acyl fluorides and alkynoates. The ability of the thus generated fluorophosphoranes to participate in ligand coupling and ligand metathesis with organosilicon nucleophiles enables synthetic transformations that are otherwise unattainable, including the intermolecular carbofluorination of alkynes and the hydroalkenylation of enol ethers. Regarding nucleophilic NHC catalysis, the use of imidazolium-based NHCs can generate deoxy-Breslow intermediates that are sufficiently nucleophilic to promote the aromatic substitution of aryl halides, aryl ethers and anilides. The protocol can also be used for the nucleophilic activation of styrene derivatives, allowing for the generation of a series of ylide intermediates that can serve as non-stabilized vinyl anion equivalents. These results demonstrate that synthetic transformations involving non-stabilized carbanions can be conducted under catalytic conditions without the use of strong organometallic nucleophiles. },

Many advancements are happening in drug delivery to develop an excellent nanocarrier to deliver drugs to target sites bypassing clinical barriers, thereby improving cellular uptake. Lipid coating on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) has significantly reduced the drawbacks of many MSNs and increased their compatibility. This study reports a dual protective acid stimuli-responsive lipid-coated core-shell mesoporous silica nanoparticle (CSMS) conjugated with cabazitaxel showing better drug release, cell uptake, and cytotoxicity, and suitability in the prostate cancer (PC-3) cell line. Initially, monodispersed CSMS were conjugated with cabazitaxel (CBZ) through a hydrazone linker (CBZ@Hy-CSMS), proving its appropriate use in designing a stimuli-responsive system. In the second part, CBZ-conjugated CSMS was coated with a lipid layer (L-CBZ@Hy-CSMS) by the liposome fusion method. The presented dual protective CSMS system showed a significant increase in drug delivery at pH 5.4 compared to 7.4, with a drastic decrease in premature drug release when exposed to pH 7.4. The lipid-coated CSMS showed excellent biocompatibility and better cellular uptake with enhanced cell cytotoxicity in PC-3 cancer cells as compared to the uncoated CSMS. CSMS with a lipid coating combined with a stimuli-responsive system could improve the therapeutic delivery and treatment difficulties in many other cell lines and diseases. },

Efficient storage and transport of electric energy is essential to promote the use of renewable energy based electricity. We demonstrate an energy cycle based on highly selective redox reactions between lactic acid (Lac) and pyruvic acid (Pyr), both of which are liquid under ambient conditions and can be obtained from biomass resources, thus realizing a completely low-emission system. As an energy storage device, an electrosynthesis cell (LAEC) for the production of Lac from Pyr was constructed using a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) consisting of a TiO2 cathode catalyst for the electroreduction of Pyr and an IrOx anode catalyst for water oxidation. Our LAEC achieved highly efficient Lac production from 10 M Pyr aqueous solution with Faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 100% in the applied voltage range of 1.4\u20132.4 V, resulting in an energy conversion efficiency of 50% and a current density of \u22120.4 A cm\u22122 at 2.0 V. Direct Lac fuel cell (DLAFC) was also constructed and its FE values for the Pyr production reached approximately 100%, enabling direct electronic energy storage in bio-derivative liquid carriers and efficient energy circulation with minimal CO2 emissions. },

Three kinds of nucleic acid base-containing lipids were synthesized and the surface behaviors of these compounds in monolayer and bilayer systems were examined. In the monolayer systems, the addition of a complementary nucleoside to a subphase solution extended the monolayer much more efficiently than that of other nucleosides because of hydrogen bonding between a pair of complementary bases. In the monolayer and bilayer systems, the photodimerization reaction of a thymine ring was confirmed by the change in the surface pressure of the monolayer and the decrease in absorbance and the broadening of the phase-transition peak in the DSC curve of the liposome solution. },

By using newly developed guanylating agents, octadecyl- and dioctadecylguanidinium amphiphiles were synthesized. The interaction between each guanidinium monolayer and polycarboxylates in the subphase was investigated on the basis of the \u03c0\u2013A isotherm, FT-IR spectroscopy, and XPS measurements. When linear dicarboxylates were used, the molecular areas of the monolayer increased, as the length of the methylene chain between the carboxylate groups increased. The expansion of the molecular area was greater for the octadecylguanidinium monolayers than for the dioctadecylguanidinium monolayers. The molecular packing was affected by the shape of polycarboxylate molecules in the case of phthalate, cis-1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylate, and 1,1-cyclohexanediacetate. It is clear that, the molecular packing in the complexed monolayers is governed by the distance and relative orientation of the two carboxylate groups in a polycarboxylate. With all of the dicarboxylates, excluding oxalate, FT-IR and XPS measurements of the LB films indicated the formation of 1 : 1 guanidinium\/carboxylate pairs with hydrogen bonding interactions. Oxalate produced an asymmetric complex where one guanidinium was bound to oxalate through hydrogen bonding, and the other guanidinium existed as a non-hydrogen bonded counter ion. These results are useful for the development of two-dimensional molecular patterns. },

Ribonuclease R assay was used to confirm the stability of circ_0066147. circ_0066147, miR-326 and E2F transcription factor 2 (E2F2) expression levels was detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion abilities were assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2 H -tetrazolium bromide, flow cytometry, wound-healing and transwell assays, respectively. Targeted relationships among circ_0066147, miR-326 and E2F2 were verified by the dual-luciferase reporter or RNA pull-down assay. \n                \n                \n                   Results \n

Hydrogels are being investigated for their application in inducing the regeneration of various tissues, and suitable conditions for each tissue are becoming more apparent. Conditions such as the mechanical properties, degradation period, degradation mechanism, and cell affinity can be tailored by changing the molecular structure, especially in the case of polymers. Furthermore, many high-functional hydrogels with drug delivery systems (DDSs), in which drugs or bioactive substances are contained in controlled hydrogels, have been reported. This review focuses on the molecular design and function of biopolymer-based hydrogels and introduces recent developments in functional hydrogels for clinical applications. },

Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) is a unique research topic and property that can lead to a wide range of applications, including cellular imaging, theranostics, analyte quantitation and the specific detection of biologically important species. Towards the development of the AIE-active materials, many aromatic moieties composed of tetraphenylethylene, anthracene, pyrene, etc., have been developed. Among these aromatic moieties, pyrene is an aromatic hydrocarbon with a polycyclic flat structure containing four fused benzene rings to provide an unusual electron delocalization feature that is important in the AIE property. Numerous pyrene-based AIE-active materials have been reported with the AIE property towards sensing, imaging and theranostics applications. Most importantly, these AIE-active pyrene moieties exist as small molecules, Schiff bases, polymers, supramolecules, metal-organic frameworks, etc. This comprehensive review outlines utilizations of AIE-active pyrene-based materials on the imaging and theranostics studies. Moreover, the design and synthesis of these pyrene-based molecules are delivered with discussions on their future scopes. },

An electrochemical HbA1c sensor with high sensitivity and good specificity is proposed based on the electrochemical immune principle. The reproducibility and conductivity of the electrode are improved by depositing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the surface of the screen-printed electrode (SPE). The HbA1c antibodies are immobilized on the surface of the modified electrode by adsorption to capture the HbA1c in the sample. The hindering effect of HbA1c on the electrode transfer reaction was exploited as the HbA1c detection mechanism. The electrode\u2019s properties were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the measurement properties of the electrode were analyzed using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The experimental results show that the peak current signal of the electrochemical immunosensor produced a linear response to HbA1c in the concentration range of 20\u2013200 \u03bcg\/mL, a linear relationship coefficient of 0.9812, a detection limit of 15.5 \u00b5g\/mL, and a sensitivity of 0.0938 \u00b5A\/\u00b5g\u00b7mL\u22121. The sensor delivered satisfactory repeatability, stability, and anti-interference performance. Due to its small size, high sensitivity, and wide linear detection range, it is expected to play a significant role in managing diabetes at home. },

Nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, metal\u2013organic frameworks, metal nanoparticles, and porous carbon, play a crucial role as efficient carriers to enhance enzyme activity through substrate channeling while improving enzyme stability and reusability. However, there are significant debates surrounding aspects such as enzyme orientation, enzyme loading, retention of enzyme activity, and immobilization techniques. Consequently, these subjects have become the focus of intensive research in the realm of multi-enzyme cascade reactions. Researchers have undertaken the challenge of creating functional in vitro multi-enzyme systems, drawing inspiration from natural multi-enzyme processes within living organisms. Substantial progress has been achieved in designing multi-step reactions that harness the synthetic capabilities of various enzymes, particularly in applications such as biomarker detection (e.g., biosensors) and the development of biofuel cells. This review provides an overview of recent developments in concurrent and sequential approaches involving two or more enzymes in sequence. It delves into the intricacies of multi-enzyme cascade reactions conducted on nanostructured electrodes, addressing both the challenges encountered and the innovative solutions devised in this field. },

Much attention has been paid to the synthesis of low-dimensional materials from small units such as functional molecules. Bottom-up approaches to create new low-dimensional materials with various functional units can be realized with the emerging concept of nanoarchitectonics. In this review article, we overview recent research progresses on materials nanoarchitectonics at two-dimensional liquid interfaces, which are dimensionally restricted media with some freedoms of molecular motion. Specific characteristics of molecular interactions and functions at liquid interfaces are briefly explained in the first parts. The following sections overview several topics on materials nanoarchitectonics at liquid interfaces, such as the preparation of two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks, and the fabrication of low-dimensional and specifically structured nanocarbons and their assemblies at liquid\u2013liquid interfaces. Finally, interfacial nanoarchitectonics of biomaterials including the regulation of orientation and differentiation of living cells are explained. In the recent examples described in this review, various materials such as molecular machines, molecular receptors, block-copolymer, DNA origami, nanocarbon, phages, and stem cells were assembled at liquid interfaces by using various useful techniques. This review overviews techniques such as conventional Langmuir\u2013Blodgett method, vortex Langmuir\u2013Blodgett method, liquid\u2013liquid interfacial precipitation, instructed assembly, and layer-by-layer assembly to give low-dimensional materials including nanowires, nanowhiskers, nanosheets, cubic objects, molecular patterns, supramolecular polymers, metal-organic frameworks and covalent organic frameworks. The nanoarchitecture materials can be used for various applications such as molecular recognition, sensors, photodetectors, supercapacitors, supramolecular differentiation, enzyme reactors, cell differentiation control, and hemodialysis. },

The development of nanotechnology has provided an opportunity to integrate a wide range of phenomena and disciplines from the atomic scale, the molecular scale, and the nanoscale into materials. Nanoarchitectonics as a post-nanotechnology concept is a methodology for developing functional material systems using units such as atoms, molecules, and nanomaterials. Especially, molecular nanoarchitectonics has been strongly promoted recently by incorporating nanotechnological methods into organic synthesis. Examples of research that have attracted attention include the direct observation of organic synthesis processes at the molecular level with high resolution, and the control of organic syntheses with probe microscope tips. These can also be considered as starting points for nanoarchitectonics. In this review, these examples of molecular nanoarchitectonics are introduced, and future prospects of nanoarchitectonics are discussed. The fusion of basic science and the application of practical functional materials will complete materials chemistry for everything. },

In this paper we detail a novel semi-automated method for the production of graphene by sonochemical exfoliation of graphite in the presence of ionic surfactants, e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The formation of individual graphene flakes was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, while the interaction of graphene with surfactants was proven by NMR spectroscopy. The resulting graphene\u2013surfactant composite material formed a stable suspension in water and some organic solvents, such as chloroform. Graphene thin films were then produced using Langmuir\u2013Blodgett (LB) or electrostatic layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition techniques. The composition and morphology of the films produced was studied with SEM\/EDX and AFM. The best results in terms of adhesion and surface coverage were achieved using LbL deposition of graphene(\u2212)SDS alternated with polyethyleneimine (PEI). The optical study of graphene thin films deposited on different substrates was carried out using UV\u2013vis absorption spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry. A particular focus was on studying graphene layers deposited on gold-coated glass using a method of total internal reflection ellipsometry (TIRE) which revealed the enhancement of the surface plasmon resonance in thin gold films by depositing graphene layers. },

Shanbei folk song, an art form full of flavor and emotion, carries the deep historical and cultural heritage of the Shanbei region. It is not only a form of music, but also a kind of emotional communication, a kind of cultural communication. Songs are emotional bridges across cultures and languages, and through translation, the emotions and life experiences of the people of northern Shaanxi can be shared with people all over the world. By translating northern Shaanxi folk songs into English, more people can understand and appreciate this unique art form, thus better spreading traditional Chinese culture. However, when translators try to translate them into English, many difficulties and challenges follow, such as language barriers and cultural differences. Therefore, how to correctly deal with the challenges and accomplish high-quality translation is the key concern of every translator.

Despite extensive research into the biology of CRC (colorectal cancer), and recent advances in surgical techniques and chemotherapy, CRC continues to be a major cause of death throughout the world. Therefore it is important to develop novel chemopreventive\/chemotherapeutic agents for CRC. Cannabinoids are a class of compounds that are currently used in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and in the stimulation of appetite. However, there is accumulating evidence that they could also be useful for the inhibition of tumour cell growth by modulating key survival signalling pathways. The chemotherapeutic potential for plant-derived and endogenous cannabinoids in CRC therapy is reviewed. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
 The folding of amyloid \u03b2 (1\u201340) peptide into \u03b2\u2010sheet\u2010containing fibrils is thought to play a causative role in Alzheimer's disease. Because of its amphiphilic character, the peptide can interact with phospholipid membranes. Langmuir monolayers of negatively charged DPPS, DPPG, and DMPG, and also of zwitterionic DPPC and DMPC, have been used to study the influence of the peptide on the lipid packing and, vice versa, the influence of phospholipid monolayers on the peptide secondary structure by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and grazing incidence X\u2010ray diffraction. The peptide adsorbs at the air\/water (buffer) interface, and also inserts into uncompressed phospholipid monolayers. When adsorbed at the interface, the peptide adopts a \u03b2\u2010sheet conformation, with the long axis of these \u03b2\u2010sheets oriented almost parallel to the surface. If the lipid exhibits a condensed monolayer phase, then compression of the complex monolayer with the inserted peptide leads to the squeezing out of the peptide at higher surface pressures (above 30 mN\u2009m   \u22121   ). The peptide desorbs completely from zwitterionic monolayers and negatively charged DPPG and DPPS monolayers on buffer, but remains adsorbed in the \u03b2\u2010sheet conformation at negatively charged monolayers on water. This can be explained in terms of electrostatic interactions with the lipid head groups. It also remains adsorbed at, or penetrating into, disordered anionic monolayers on buffer. Additionally, the peptide does not influence the condensed monolayer structure at physiological pH and modest ionic strength.  },

 abstract = { Abstract 
Liver fibrosis is a process of excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix caused by liver injury. Liver fibrosis can progress to cirrhosis or even liver cancer without proper intervention. Until now, no effective therapeutic drugs have been clinically approved for treating liver fibrosis. Hence, the development of safe and effective antifibrotic drugs is particularly important. As a representative biomaterial, peptides have been investigated as key components for constructing antifibrotic nanomaterials given their advantages of biological origination, synthetic availability, and good biocompatibility. Peptides serve as multifunctional motifs in antifibrotic nanomaterials, such as liver\u2010targeting molecules, antifibrotic molecules, and self\u2010assembling building blocks for the formation of the nanomaterials. In this review, we focus on peptide\u2010based nanoarchitectonics for treating liver fibrosis, including nanomaterials modified with liver\u2010targeting peptides, nanomaterials for the efficient delivery of antifibrotic peptides, and self\u2010assembled peptide nanomaterials for the delivery of antifibrotic drugs. The design rules of these peptide\u2010based nanomaterials are described. The antifibrotic mechanisms and effects of these peptide\u2010based nanomaterials in treating liver fibrosis and related diseases are highlighted. The challenges and future perspectives of using peptide\u2010based nanoarchitectonics for the treatment of liver fibrosis are discussed. These results are expected to accelerate the rational design and clinical translation of antifibrotic nanomaterials. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
To address the issues of large volume change and low conductivity of silicon (Si) materials, carbon coatings have been widely employed as surface protection agent and conductive medium to encapsulate the Si materials, which can improve the electrochemical performance of Si\u2010based electrodes. There has been a strong demand to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of efficient carbon coating over the lithiation and delithiation process of Si materials. Here, we report the first observation of the extended two\u2010phase transformation of carbon\u2010coated Si nanoparticles (Si\/C) during electrochemical processes. The Si\/C nanoparticles were prepared by sintering Si nanoparticles with polyvinylidene chloride precursor. The Si\/C electrode underwent a two\u2010phase transition during the first 20 cycles at 0.2\u2009C, but started to engage in solid solution reaction when the ordered compact carbon coating began to crack. Under higher current density conditions, the electrode was also found to be involved in solid solution reaction, which, however, was due to the overwhelming demand of kinetic property rather than the breaking of the carbon coating. In comparison, the Si\/C composites prepared with sucrose possessed more disordered and porous carbon structures, and presented solid solution reaction throughout the entire cycling process. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
Four alkyl melamine amphiphiles each containing identical triads of hydrogen\u2010bonding sites (hydrogen donor, acceptor, and donor) but different numbers of alkyl chains were examined in order to determine their monolayer properties and binding behavior towards barbituric acid (BA). Their structural organization in supramolecular assemblies at the air\u2013water interface was affected by the bulkiness of the hydrophobic part of the amphiphile. Aqueous BA and amphiphiles with two or three alkyl chains formed a 1:1 alternate network structure. In contrast, a melamine amphiphile with four alkyl chains formed a 2:1 (BA:amphiphile) complex rather than a 1:1 alternate network structure. The 2:1 complex appears to behave like an independent molecular entity without further networking. The results point to the importance of size matching between the hydrophobic part of the monolayer and the underlying hydrogen\u2010bonded network in order to maintain the overall supramolecular structure. },

We have investigated how doubly selective synthetic mimics of antimicrobial peptides (SMAMPs), which can differentiate not only between bacteria and mammalian cells, but also between Gram\u2010negative and Gram\u2010positive bacteria, make the latter distinction. By dye\u2010leakage experiments on model vesicles and complementary experiments on bacteria, we were able to relate the Gram selectivity to structural differences of these bacteria types. We showed that the double membrane of  E. coli  rather than the difference in lipid composition between  E. coli  and  S. aureus  was responsible for Gram selectivity. The molecular\u2010weight\u2010dependent antimicrobial activity of the SMAMPs was shown to be a sieving effect: while the 3000\u2005g\u2009mol \u22121  SMAMP was able to penetrate the peptidoglycan layer of the Gram\u2010positive  S. aureus  bacteria, the 50000\u2005g\u2009mol \u22121  SMAMP got stuck and consequently did not have antimicrobial activity. },

The development of visible\u2010light\u2010active photocatalysts is being investigated through various approaches. In this study, C 60 \u2010based sensitized photocatalysis that works through the charge transfer (CT) mechanism is proposed and tested as a new approach. By employing the water\u2010soluble fullerol (C 60 (OH)  x  ) instead of C 60 , we demonstrate that the adsorbed fullerol activates TiO 2  under visible\u2010light irradiation through the \u201csurface\u2013complex CT\u201d mechanism, which is largely absent in the C 60 \/TiO 2  system. Although fullerene and its derivatives have often been utilized in TiO 2 \u2010based photochemical conversion systems as an electron transfer relay, their successful photocatalytic application as a visible\u2010light sensitizer of TiO 2  is not well established. Fullerol\/TiO 2  exhibits marked visible photocatalytic activity not only for the redox conversion of 4\u2010chlorophenol, I \u2212 , and Cr VI , but also for H 2  production. The photoelectrode of fullerol\/TiO 2  also generates an enhanced anodic photocurrent under visible light as compared with the electrodes of bare TiO 2  and C 60 \/TiO 2 , which confirms that the visible\u2010light\u2010induced electron transfer from fullerol to TiO 2  is particularly enhanced. The surface complexation of fullerol\/TiO 2  induced a visible absorption band around 400\u2013500\u2005nm, which was extinguished when the adsorption of fullerol was inhibited by fluorination of the surface of TiO 2 . The transient absorption spectroscopic measurement gave an absorption spectrum ascribed to fullerol radical cations (fullerol .+ ) the generation of which should be accompanied by the proposed CT. The theoretical calculation regarding the absorption spectra for the (TiO 2  cluster+fullerol) model also confirmed the proposed CT, which involves excitation from HOMO (fullerol) to LUMO (TiO 2  cluster) as the origin of the visible\u2010light absorption. },

The design and development of mobile nano\u2010, micro\u2010, and millimeter\u2010scale autonomous systems have been perused over several decades. Here, we introduce a millimeter\u2010sized polymer capsule motor with specific features and functionalities. It runs without any external energy sources or the consumption of external fuels such as H 2 O 2  or glucose. The occurrence of motion is due to the asymmetric release of organic solvent from the capsule and the asymmetric change in the surface tension of the surrounding liquid. The capsule moves from a place of lower surface tension to a place of higher surface tension (Marangoni effect) in an attempt by the system to attain the desirable lowest\u2010free\u2010energy state. The operation of the motor is versatile in terms of the environment, as it moves on a wide variety of liquid\/air interfaces, including water, sea water, organic solvent\/water mixtures, and acids. A high\u2010motion velocity was observed, with a travelling distance of over 20 meters. The manipulation of its motion was achieved upon functionalization with nickel powder and application of an external magnetic field. Long\u2010range interaction behaviors and surface\u2010cleaning effects due to the chemotaxis effect were also demonstrated when the capsule was functionalized with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). We believe that a plethora of applications can be envisioned with this motor, such as cargo delivery, manipulation of matter, sensing and detection, biorecognition, and environmental remediation. },

Two donor\u2013bridge\u2013acceptor conjugates (5,10,15,20\u2010tetrakis[4\u2010( N , N \u2010diphenylaminobenzoate)phenyl] porphyrin (TPPZ) and 5,10,15,20\u2010tetrakis[4\u2010( N , N \u2010diphenylaminostyryl)phenyl] porphyrin (TPPX)) were covalently linked to triphenylamine (TPA) at the  meso \u2010position of porphyrin ring. The triphenylamine entities were expected to act as energy donors and the porphyrins to act as an energy acceptor. In this paper, we report on the synthesis of these multibranched\u2010porphyrin\u2010functionalized Pt nanocomposites. The conjugates used here not only served as a stabilizer to prevent agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles, but also as a light\u2010harvesting photosensitizer. The occurrence of photoinduced electron\u2010transfer processes was confirmed by time\u2010resolved fluorescence and photoelectrochemical spectral measurements. The different efficiencies for energy and electron transfer in the two multibranched porphyrins and the functionalized Pt nanocomposites were attributed to diverse covalent linkages. Moreover, in the reduction of water to produce H 2 , the photocatalytic activity of the Pt nanocomposite functionalized by TPPX, in which the triphenylamine and porphyrin moieties are bonded through an ethylene bridge, was much higher than that of the platinum nanocomposite functionalized by TPPZ, in which the two moieties are bonded through an ester. This investigation demonstrates the fundamental advantages of constructing donor\u2013bridge\u2013acceptor conjugates as highly efficient photosensitizers based on efficient energy and electron transfer. },

One dyad showed the asymmetric current\u2013voltage ( I\u2013V ) curve characteristic for rectification, unlike control compounds containing the TTF unit but not the exTCNQ moiety or comprising the exTCNQ acceptor moiety but lacking the donor TTF part, which both gave symmetric  I\u2013V  curves. The direction of the observed rectification indicated that the preferred electron current flows from the exTCNQ acceptor to the TTF donor. },

Their covalently linked nanoconjugates with mercaptosuccinic acid\u2010capped ternary CdSeTe\/CdTeS\/ZnSeS quantum dots are prepared in the presence of an ethyl(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide activating agent. Optical limiting (OL) properties of the obtained low\u2010symmetry complexes and their conjugates with quantum dots (QDs) are measured for the first time by the open\u2010aperture Z\u2010scan technique (532\u2005nm laser and pulse rate of 10\u2005ns). For comparison, symmetrical double\u2010 and triple\u2010decker Eu III octa\u2010 n \u2010butoxyphthalocyaninates 5 and 6 and their mixtures with trioctylphosphine oxide\u2010capped QDs are also synthesized and studied. It is revealed that both lowering of molecular symmetry and expansion of the \u03c0\u2010electron system upon moving from double\u2010 to triple\u2010decker complexes significantly improves the OL characteristics, making the low\u2010symmetry triple\u2010decker complex 3 the most efficient optical limiter in the studied family of sandwich complexes, affording 50\u2009% lowering of light transmittance below 0.5\u2005J\u2009cm \u22122 input fluence. Conjugation (both covalent and noncovalent) with QDs affords further enhancement of the OL properties of both double\u2010 and triple\u2010decker complexes. Altogether, the obtained results contribute to the development of novel nonlinear optical materials for future nanoelectronic and optical device applications. },

Complex  1\u2009a , with  N , N\u2032 \u2010dipentyl groups, exhibits intense red emission in 2\u2010methyl\u20102,3,4,5\u2010tetrahydrofuran (2\u2010MeTHF) at 298\u2005K, whereas the analogues  2\u2009a \u2013 4\u2009a  are less or non\u2010emissive under the same measurement conditions. All four complexes are highly emissive at 77\u2005K. The heat\u2010resistant properties toward thermal emission quenching ( \u03a6  298\u2005K \/ \u03a6  77\u2005K ) increase in the order  1\u2009a  (0.52)> 2\u2009a  (0.09)> 3\u2009a  (0.02)>> 4\u2009a  (0.00). We investigated the emission decay and thermal\u2010deactivation processes using density functional theory (DFT), time\u2010dependent (TD) DFT, and double\u2010hybrid density functional theory (DHDF) calculations of  N , N\u2032 \u2010diethyl forms  1\u2009b \u2013 4\u2009b , and discuss the results with a focus on the energy levels, molecular structures, and electronic configurations in the triplet excited states. The energy differences between the triplet metal\u2013ligand charge transfer ( 3 MLCT) state and minimum\u2010energy crossing point between the lowest triplet state and singlet ground state (MECP) increase in the order  1\u2009a > 2\u2009a ,\u2009 3\u2009a > 4\u2009a , consistent with the experimental results for the heat\u2010resistant properties of these complexes. The origin of the present structure dependence of the  3 MLCT\u2013MECP energy gap is ascribed to the ease or difficulty of the high\u2010lying d \u03c3*  orbital participating in the MECP upon thermal structural distortion. The structure dependence in energy gaps between the \u03c0* and d \u03c3*  orbitals, which is key for facilitating the thermal deactivation process, is rationally correlated with the extent of aromaticity on the coordination platforms ( 1\u2009b >( 2\u2009b ,\u2009 3\u2009b )> 4\u2009b ). },

Material science is a broad discipline focused on subjects such as metals, ceramics, polymers, electronics, and composite materials. Each of these fields covers areas associated with designing, synthesizing, and manufacturing, materials. These are tasks in which the use of technology may constitute paramount importance, reducing cost and time to develop new materials and substituting try-and-error standard procedures. This study aimed to analyze, quantify and map the scientific production of research on the fourth industrial revolution linked to material science studies in Scopus and Web of Science databases from 2017 to 2021. For this bibliometric analysis, the Biblioshiny software from RStudio was employed to categorize and evaluate the contribution of authors, countries, institutions, and journals. VOSviewer was used to visualize their collaboration networks. As a result, we found that artificial intelligence represents a hotspot technology used in material science, which has become usual in molecular simulations and manufacturing industries. Recent studies aim to provide possible avenues in the discovery and design of new high-entropy alloys as well as to detect and classify corrosion in the industrial sector. This bibliometric analysis releases an updated perspective on the implementations of technologies in material science as a possible guideline for future worldwide research. },

The use of aptamers in biosensing has attracted considerable attention as an alternative to antibodies because of their unique properties such as long-term stability, cost-effectiveness and adjustability to various applications. Among cancers, the early diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the greatest concerns for ageing men worldwide. One of the most commonly used biomarkers for PCa is prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which can be found in elevated levels in patients with cancer. This review presents the gradual transition of research from antibody-based to aptamerbased biosensors, specifically for PSA. A brief description on aptamer-based biosensing for other PCa biomarkers is also presented. Special attention is given to electrochemical methods as analytical techniques for the development of simple, sensitive and cost-effective biosensors. The review also focuses on the different surface chemistries exploited for fabrication and their applications in clinical samples. The use of aptamers represents a promising tool for the development of point-ofcare biosensors for the early detection of prostate cancer. In view of the unmatched upper hand of aptamers, future prospects are also discussed, not only in the point-of-care format but also in other novel applications. },

Specific interactions of yttrium and lanthanum ions with a fatty acid Langmuir monolayer were investigated using vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy (VSFS). The trivalent ions were shown to interact with the charged form of the carboxylic acid group from nanomolar concentrations (<300 nM). Analysis of the spectral features from both the symmetric and the asymmetric carboxylate modes reveals the presence of at least three distinct coordination structures linked to specific binding configurations. Although the same species were identified for both La3+ and Y3+, they display a different concentration dependence, highlighting the ion-specificity of the interaction. From the response of interfacial water molecules, charge reversion, as well as the formation of yttrium hydroxide complexes, were detected upon increasing the amount of salt in the solution. The binding interaction and kinetics of absorption are sensitive to the solution pH, showing a distinct ion speciation in the interfacial region when compared to the bulk. Changing the subphase pH or adding a monovalent background electrolyte that promotes deprotonation of the carboxylic acid headgroup, could further improve the detection limit of La3+ and Y3+ to concentrations <100 nM. These findings demonstrate that nM concentrations of trace metals contaminants, typically found on monovalent salts, can significantly influence the binding structure and kinetics in Langmuir monolayers. },

The one-pot synthesis of antimicrobial bottle brush copolymers is presented. RAFT polymerization is used for production of the polymeric backbone, as well as for the grafts, which were installed using a grafting from approach. A combination of N-iso propyl acrylamide and a Boc protected primary amine-containing acrylamide was used in different composition. After deprotection polymers featuring different charge densities were obtained in both, linear and bottle brush topology. Antimicrobial activity was tested against three clinically relevant bacteria strains and growth inhibition was significantly increased in bottle brush copolymers. Blood compatibility investigations revealed strong hemagglutination for linear copolymers and pronounced hemolysis for bottle brush copolymers. However, one bottle brush copolymer with a 50% charge density strong antibacterial activity and negligible blood toxicity resulting in selectivity values as high as 320. Membrane models were used to probe the mechanism of shown polymers, which was found to be based on membrane disruption. The trends from biology are accurately reflected in model systems indicating that differences in lipid composition are responsible for selectivity. However, bottle brush copolymers were found to possess increased cytotoxicity against HEK cells when compared with linear analogues. The introduced synthetic platform enables screening of further parameters associated to bottle brush copolymers, which might lead to even better activity profiles. },

Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) comprising a metal core of few atoms and a shell of thiols have unique photoluminescence unlike its bigger counterparts. Due to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer, long-lived excited state and excited triplet state has been exhibited by some metal clusters attributing to their inherent photosensitizing (PS) property. Hence, AuNCs have significant impact in biomedical domains like image assisted photodynamic therapy (PDT). In this work, the molecular nanoarchitectonics of self assembled cysteine-capped AuNCs has been tailored to improve its photosensitizing and emission properties for PDT and simultaneous imaging applications. The unique molecular nanoarchitectonics contributed to the aggregation induced emission (AIE) property of gold cluster contributing to the enhanced photosensitizing and bio-imaging property. We performed in-silico model to study the interaction of cysteine to gold cluster, its ground and excited-state properties, and the charge transfer mechanism. Cysteine-capped AuNCs yielded efficient generation of cytotoxic radicals which has contributions from the dispersed independent gold cluster as well as the self assembled nanoarchitecture. Thus, the cysteine-capped AuNCs could generate free radicals for cancer therapy by both Type I and Type II photosensitizing pathways, with the Type I reaction relevant for use in the hypoxic tumour environment. The metal cluster also exhibited excellent biocompatibility in cancer cells. The image-guided photodynamic exhibited significant cell death after 60s laser irradiation. Thus, the unique molecular nanoarchitectonics of the synthesised AuNCs has resulted in a promising new theranostic nano-platform with potential clinical applications. },

The redox state of the phthalocyanine in sandwich lanthanide complexes is crucial for their applications. In this work, we demonstrate that the cation-induced supramolecular assembly of crown-substituted phthalocyanine lanthanide complexes Ln[(15C5)4Pc]2 can be used to control the redox state of the ligand simultaneously with the coordination sphere of the central metal. We achieve unprecedented redox switching of phthalocyanine ligands in a double-decker Gd(III) complex, resulting from the intramolecular inclusion of potassium cations between the decks with simultaneous twisting of the ligands (the skew angle between them decreases from 44.61\u00b0 to 0.21\u00b0). Such a structural change leads to an increase in the deck to deck distance and drastically facilitates ligand reduction. It was demonstated that this process is anion dependent. Thus, only potassium salts of weak acids (KOPiv, KOAc) induce intramolecular inclusion of cations with redox switching in contrast to salts of strong acids (KBr, KOPic, KSCN and KPF6), where such a redox process does not occur. This breakthrough opens new avenues for controlling the electrochromic properties of phthalocyanines, along with other properties, such as electrical conductivity, optics, etc. },

The bridging role of aggregate between single-molecule structures and macroscopic photophysical properties has attracted intense attention. Pyrene (Py), as the simplest dimer candidate, is a proper model for studying accurate structure-property relationships of aggregates. Herein, a series of Py and derivatives were systematically investigated. With a largely planar and conjugated conformation, Py shows anomalous aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics due to the oxygen quenching at the molecular level but turn-on fluorescence in the aggregate state because of the oxygen isolation. Although introducing substituents induces molecular motion and weakened luminescence in the molecular state, the impact of substituents on the aggregate-state photophysical properties enormously differs. A small and electron-conjugated substituent (-CHO) can generate long-range ordered dimer stacking, leading to redshifted and weakened emission. Meanwhile, the larger substituent (-CyA) can disrupt long-range stacking and result in discrete dimers, leading to blue-shifted but enhanced emission. Further, incorporating a natural and bulky alicyclic structure (-DAA) inhibits dimer formation and activates strong molecular motions in the crystalline state, resulting in the shortest wavelength and weakest emission. Interestingly, crystalline Py-DAA exhibits both mechanochromic and acidichromic properties, which can be synergistically applied in dynamic encryption-decryption. These results indicate that substituents significantly affect their fluorescent behaviors due to the complexity of aggregate structures. This work not only elucidates the unique AIE performance of Py for the first time but also applies it as an accurate model for regulating the aggregate structures, offering precise molecular design strategies for aggregate-state luminescent materials. },

Materials fabrication with nanoscale structural precision based on bottom-up-type self-assembly has become more important in various current disciplines in chemistry including materials chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, analytical chemistry, biochemistry, colloid and surface chemistry, and supramolecular chemistry. Although the design of new materials based on nanoscale self-assembly is anticipated as a key concept, preparing complete three-dimensional structures at nanoscale precision remains a difficult target using current technologies. Rather, dimension-reduced approaches such as layering of two-dimensional nanostructures into precisely controlled lamellar nanomaterials are currently achievable. In particular, layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly is known as a highly versatile method for fabrication of controlled layered structures from various kinds of component materials using very simple, inexpensive, and rapid procedures. Therefore, fabrication of multilayer films through the LbL deposition process has attracted growing interest from various research communities. The high versatility and flexibility of LbL assembly is continuously creating new concepts, new materials, new procedures, and new applications. In this highlight review, we focus on nanoarchitectonics by LbL assembly. After an initial introduction on the invention and a brief history of the LbL assembly technique, innovations and the evolution of the technique are described based mainly on recent examples, which are categorized into two sections: (i) developments in methodology (technical, material, and phenomenological aspects with expansion of concept) and (ii) progress in applications (physical, chemical\/biochemical, and biomedical applications). },

The clay deposits in fractures of the metamorphic basement under the Paris Basin sedimentary formations at Sancerre-Couy (France) are composed of trioctahedral species which are exceptionally well crystallized. Three samples were chosen in order to study the chemical composition of 100% expandable saponite, 50% expandable corrensite and 10% expandable chlorite-saponite mixed-layer mineral C 90 \u2013S 10  Two sets of microchemical analyses were performed in order to determine the variations of the composition on large and small numbers of particles. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and M\u00f6ssbauer spectrometry were performed on purified samples. 
The mathematical decomposition of Si, Al and Mg histograms established from microanalyses of a large number of crystals of saponite, corrensite and C 90 \u2013S 10  evidences bimodal populations. The total Fe content of the three species is unimodal whatever the chemical composition of the surrounding rock and the Fe 2+ \/Fe 3+  ratio. The structural formulae established from a large number of microanalyses of a few particles show that there are no parental relationships between saponite, corrensite and C 90 \u2013S 10 . The expandable layer of corrensite is characterized by a high charge. It is proposed that the tetrahedral sheets adjacent to the brucitic sheet and the exchangeable interlayer in a 2 : 1 unit are identical in corrensite. },

Interfacial anomalies are important keys to understand molecular recognition in aqueous media and to propose possible scenarios for the origin of cell membranes.

Although forefront research fields on molecular machineries and nano\u2010manipulation have been developed, their current achievements stay mostly in basic science and are far from practical usages in daily life. In this short review, interfacial nanoarchitectonics for structural and functional tuning of molecular machines, molecular receptors, and related molecular objects is conceptually overviewed towards possible applications. As their typical functions, regulation methods of molecular recognitions and the other functions in three mode, (i) fixed structure mode, (ii) switching mode, and (iii) tuning mode, are mainly discussed. The exemplified facts reveal great possibilities in molecular tuning at interfaces. The functional molecules immobilized at interfacial media can be manipulated in relation with macroscopic human motions, which would be one of the promising ways to use molecular\u2010level functions in life\u2010related activities. },

Nanoarchitectonics is the methodology for production of functional materials from nano\u2010units. In nanoarchitectonics, the conversion of molecules (chemistry, Chem), the control of nanostructures (nanotechnology, Nano), and the production of materials (materials science, Mat) are essential elements. In order to explain the contribution of Chem, Nano, and Mat to nanoarchitectonics, this review article is described according to two major sections, Chem & Nano and Nano to Mat. In Chem & Nano section, the integration of chemistry and nanotechnology is overviewed, and the next section, Nano to Mat, illustrates how molecules and nanomaterials are architecturally transformed into functional materials. These include supramolecular polymers and functional metal\u2010organic frameworks, which have attracted widespread attention, as well as emerging areas such as organic reactions by nanotechnology, chemical synthesis in nanospace, and material creation by dynamic motions at interfaces.

Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy presents a rapid, non-destructive method to identify chemical and biological samples with up to single molecule sensitivity. Since its discovery in 1974, the technique has become an intense field of interdisciplinary research, typically generating >2000 publications per year since 2011. The technique relies on the localised surface plasmon resonance phenomenon, where incident light can couple with plasmons at the interface that result in the generation of an intense electric field. This field can propagate from the surface from the metal-dielectric interface, so molecules within proximity will experience more intense Raman scattering. Localised surface plasmon resonance wavelength is determined by a number of factors, such as size, geometry and material. Due to the requirements of the surface optical response, Ag and Au are typical metals used for surface enhanced Raman applications. These metals then need to have nano features that improve the localised surface plasmon resonance, several variants of these substrates exist; surfaces can range from nanoparticles in a suspension, electrochemically roughened electrodes to metal nanostructures on a substrate. The latter will be the focus of this review, particularly reviewing substrates made by oblique angle deposition. Oblique angle deposition is the technique of growing thin films so that the material flux is not normal to the surface. Films grown in this fashion will possess nanostructures, due to the atomic self-shadowing effect, that are dependent mainly on the deposition angle. Recent developments, applications and highlights of surface enhanced Raman scattering substrates made by oblique angle deposition will be reviewed. },

Novel single\u2010molecule techniques allow the observation of single\u2010molecular motors in real time under physiological conditions. This enables one to gain previously inaccessible information about the mechanics of molecular motors, especially their mechano\u2010chemical coupling. As an example, we discuss the DNA import motor of the bacteriophage  \u03d5 29 and protein import into chloroplasts. In contrast to these highly developed biological molecular motors, artificial molecular motors are still at an early stage of development. Nevertheless, they already give a wealth of information. Our review focuses on how the investigation of artificial and biological molecular motors can mutually enrich each other. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
The performance of opto\u2010electronic devices built from low\u2010molecular\u2010weight dye molecules depends crucially on the stacking properties and the resulting coupling of the chromophoric systems. Herein we investigate the influence of H\u2010bonding amide and bulky substituents on the \u03c0\u2010stacking of pyrene\u2010containing small molecules in dilute solution, as supramolecular aggregates, and in the solid state. A set of four pyrene derivatives was synthesized in which benzene or 4\u2010tert\u2010butyl benzene was linked to the pyrene unit either through an ester or an amide. All four molecules form supramolecular H\u2010aggregates in THF solution at concentrations above 1\u00d710 \u22124  mol\u2009L \u22121 . These aggregates were transferred on a solid support and crystallized. We investigate: the excimer formation rates within supramolecular aggregates; the formation of H\u2010bonds as well as the optical changes during the transition from the amorphous to the crystalline state; and the excimer to monomer fluorescence ratio in crystalline films at low temperatures. We reveal that in solution supramolecular aggregation depends predominantly on the pyrene chromophores. In the crystalline state, however, the pyrene stacking can be controlled gradually by H\u2010bonding and steric effects. These results are further confirmed by molecular modeling. This work bears fundamental information for tailoring the solid state of functional optoelectronic materials. },

Reversible dynamic control of structure is a significant challenge in molecular nanotechnology. Previously, we have reported a mechanically induced continuous (analog) conformational variation in an amphiphilic binaphthyl, where closing of molecular pliers was achieved by compression of a molecular monolayer composed of these molecules at the air\u2013water interface. In this work we report that a phase transition induced by an applied mechanical stress enables discontinuous digital (1\/0) opening of simple binaphthyl molecular pliers. A lipid matrix at the air\u2013water interface promotes the formation of quasi\u2010stable nanocrystals, in which binaphthyl molecules have an open  transoid  configuration. The crystallization\/dissolution of quasi\u2010stable binaphthyl crystals with accompanying conformational change is reversible and repeatable. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
The methodology of nanoarchitectonics is to construct functional materials using nanounits such as atoms, molecules, and nanoobjects, just like architecting buildings. Nanoarchitectonics pursues the ultimate concept of materials science through the integration of related fields. In this review paper, under the title of interface\u2010interactive nanoarchitectonics, several examples of structure fabrication and function development at interfaces will be discussed, highlighting the importance of architecting materials with nanoscale considerations. Two sections provide some examples at the solid and liquid surfaces. In solid interfacial environments, molecular structures can be precisely observed and analyzed with theoretical calculations. Solid surfaces are a prime site for nanoarchitectonics at the molecular level. Nanoarchitectonics of solid surfaces has the potential to pave the way for cutting\u2010edge functionality and science based on advanced observation and analysis. Liquid surfaces are more kinetic and dynamic than solid interfaces, and their high fluidity offers many possibilities for structure fabrications by nanoarchitectonics. The latter feature has advantages in terms of freedom of interaction and diversity of components, therefore, liquid surfaces may be more suitable environments for the development of functionalities. The final section then discusses what is needed for the future of material creation in nanoarchitectonics. },

In this work, we assemble amphiphilic iron(III) corroles at air\u2010water interfaces into well\u2010defined quasi\u2010two\u2010dimensional molecular monolayers and theirs stacks for sensing of nitric oxide (NO). For this purpose, we use the Langmuir\u2010Blodgett (LB) technique, which allows varying the packing density of iron(III) corroles anchored to the aqueous subphase via one molecular side. The stacks of ten down to three molecular monolayers on the front and back sides of the substrates are sufficiently optically dense to detect NO binding to the layers photometrically. This sensing with few layers demonstrates the potential for electronic detection, where very thin surface functionalizations enable efficient electronic communication between the layer and the (semi)conductor. Despite increasing optical densities, the spectral responses to NO exposure become smaller with increasing packing density until the collapse point of the monolayers is reached. This demonstrates that the highest molecular efficiency for binding and detection of NO is achieved at the smallest packing densities. This finding is relevant to all molecular sensor films with axial binding of analytes to the sensor molecules and demonstrates the advantage of sensor molecule assembly into monolayers on water\u2010air interfaces using the LB technique. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
Polar 2D macromolecular structures have attracted significant attention because of their ferroelectricity and ferro\u2010magnetism. However, it is challenging to synthesize them experimentally because dipoles or spins of these macromolecules tend to cancel each other. So far, there has been no successful strategy for assembling macromolecules in a unidirectional manner, achieving stereoregular polymerization on metal surfaces, and creating polar 2D polymer crystals. Recent progress in molecular assembly, on\u2010surface polymer synthesis, and direct control of molecules using electric field applications provides an opportunity to develop such strategies. In this regard, we first review past studies on chiral and achiral molecular assembly, on\u2010surface polymer synthesis, and orientation control of polar molecules. Then, we discuss our newly developed approach called \u201cvectorial on\u2010surface synthesis\u201d, which is based on \u201cdynamic chirality\u201d of compass precursors, stereoselective polymerization, and favorable interchain interactions originating from CH\u2010\u03c0 interactions. Finally, we conclude with a prospective outlook. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
Heterogeneity in the fluorescence of carbon dots (CDs) has been hard to figure out so far. This could potentially be related to structural factors, size or intermediate fluorophores, especially when employing the bottom\u2010up synthesis. Herein, we unveil the origin of fluorescence and spectral heterogeneity of CDs using a simple dynamic method. This work reports the room light\u2010excited green fluorescence and dual\u2010emissive N\u2010doped CDs synthesized using a hydrothermal method. Studies were carried out considering the factors of fluorescence phenomena, such as excitation\u2010independent emission, fluorescent impurities, aggregation and solvation dynamics. The new steady\u2010state, Excitation\u2010resolved area\u2010normalized emission spectroscopy (ERANES) and ensemble measurements, including time\u2010resolved studies reveal that a heterogeneous environment exists in the ground state. Eventually, the results show the existence of core, edge and surface states in the CDs. Additionally, the fluorescence characteristics depend on the structural functionalization that occurs in both the intrinsic and extrinsic states of the CDs and it is proven that this does not violate the Kasha\u2010Vavilov rule. Although a highly purified material could still exhibit heterogeneity due to the ensemble emissive states and structural variations. Our results provide insights into the enduring debates about fluorescence and a deeper understanding of the structure\u2010 property relationship of CDs. },

A simple synthetic method was designed, in which the Sonogashira coupling reaction and [2+2] cycloaddition click reaction with high yield were performed on 1-bromopyrene to obtain several novel pyrene derivatives. The structure of each sample was characterized by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Mass Spectrometry (MS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and elemental analysis. The characterization of the products by Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy proves that the addition of click groups has an important effect on the optoelectronic properties of pyrene derivatives. The Z-scan technique was used to test the third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of the samples, and it could be found that the NLO properties of the products were improved and the transition of saturable absorption and reverse saturable absorption occurred with the addition of click reagent. These factors indicate that the click-modified pyrene derivatives have potential applications in areas such as optical limiting. },

Lithium\u2013sulfur (Li\u2010S) battery is considered as one of the most promising candidates for future portable electronics and electric vehicles due to high energy density and potentially low cost. However, the severe polysulfides shuttling in Li\u2010S battery always causes low Coulombic efficiency, capacity fading, and hindering its practical commercialization. Herein, a dual\u2010functional PEI@MWCNTs\u2010CB\/MWCNTs\/PP (briefly denoted as PMS) separator is assembled through Langmuir\u2013Blodgett\u2013Scooping (LBS) technique for improvement of Li\u2010S battery performance, that is, rational integrating conductive MWCNTs multilayer on a routine PP separator with polyethyleneimine (PEI) polymer. Owing to \u201cproton\u2010sponge\u201d\u2010based PEI feature with the abundant amino\/imine groups and branched structures, the PMS separator can provide strong affinity to immobilize the negatively charged polysulfides  via  electrostatic interaction. Simultaneously, incorporated with the conductive MWCNTs multilayers for the electron transportation, the Li\u2010S cells assembled with PMS separators achieve exceptional high delivery capacity, good rate performance (~550\u00a0mAh\u00a0g \u22121  at a current density of 9\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 ), and stable cycling retention (retention of 84.5% at a current density of 1\u00a0A\u00a0g \u22121 ) even over 120 cycles, especially in the case of high\u2010loading sulfur cathode (80 wt% of S content). This multifunctional separator with dual\u2010structural architectures  via  self\u2010assembly LBS method paves new avenues to develop high\u2010performance Li\u2010S batteries. },

In the present work, we report on the synthesis of EuSO 4  powders by two different methods using EuS as starting material. The compound EuSO 4  contains divalent europium and crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system, space group  P  nma  with parameters close to SrSO 4 . The compound exhibits near isotropic thermal expansion over the temperature range 300\u2013700\u2005K. EuSO 4  was examined by Raman, Fourier\u2010transform infrared absorption and luminescence spectroscopy methods. EuSO 4  is found to be an indirect bandgap material with a bandgap close to direct electronic transition. The emission lifetime of divalent europium  d\u2010f  emission in EuSO 4  shows an unusual behavior for stoichiometric compounds, as it shortens upon cooling from 1.11(1) \u03bcs at room temperature to 0.44(1) \u03bcs at 77\u2005K. },

Their interactions with a series of heavy metals (HM) ions (Cu 2+ , Pb 2+ , Hg 2+  and Cd 2+ ) present in the aqueous subphase were investigated by measuring surface pressure\u2010area isotherms, at different concentrations. The surface pressure\u2010area (\u03a0\u2010A) isotherms were stable and demonstrated the HM amounts influence on the limiting area (A lim ) values, therefore confirming the examined macrocycles capability to host the metallic toxicants. Additionally, a HM concentration dependence was realized and interpreted by a selective tendency of both ionophores towards Cu 2+  and Cd 2+  ions over Pb 2+  and Hg 2+ , especially at high concentrations. The HM ions interactions with the applied calix[4]resorcinarene Langmuir ultra\u2010thin monolayers were interpreted based on the Gibbs\u2010Shishkovsky adsorption equation. Moreover, quartz crystal microbalance with impedance measurement (QCM\u2010I), was applied for the detection of HM ions in solutions. The QCM\u2010I results showed the effectiveness of the coated QCM\u2010I crystals in detecting the ions at different concentrations. The detection limit values were in the order of 0.16, 0.3, 0.65, 1.1\u2005ppm (Ionophore I), as well 0.11, 0.45, 0.2, 0.89 (Ionophore II) for the Cu 2+ , Pb 2+ , Hg 2+  and Cd 2+  cations, respectively. Additionally, a selective tendency of both ionophores towards copper ions was shown. },

The high latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) potential of phase change materials (PCMs) has long promised a step-change in the energy density for thermal storage applications. However, the uptake of PCM systems has been limited due to their relatively slow charging response, limited life, and economic considerations. Fortunately, a concerted global research effort is now underway to remove these remaining technical challenges. The bibliometric analysis of this review reveals that a major focus is now on the development of nano-enhanced phase change materials (NePCM), which have the potential to mitigate many of these technical challenges for PCM-based thermal energy storage systems. As such, our bibliometric analysis has zeroed in on research in the field of thermal energy storage using NePCMs since 1977. It was found that journal articles were the most frequently used document type, representing 79% of the records and that the pace of new work in this specific area has increased exponentially over these two decades, with China accounting for the highest number of citations and the most publications (168), followed by India and Iran. China has also played a central role in the collaboration network among the most productive countries, while Saudi Arabia and Vietnam show the highest international collaboration level. },

 Emerging organic contaminants (EOC) are synthetic or naturally occurring chemicals that have the potential to enter the environment and cause known or suspected adverse ecological and human health effects. Despite not being commonly monitored, EOC are often detected in effluents and water bodies because of their inefficient removal in conventional wastewater treatment plants. There is a growing concern about the presence and impact of EOC as well as the need for reliable and effective water monitoring using sensors capable of detecting the target molecules in complex media. Due to their specificities, such as fast response times, low cost, portability and user-friendly operation, electronic tongue (e-tongue) systems present some advantages over the traditional analytical techniques (e.g., chromatographic systems) used for environmental monitoring. We reviewed e-tongue sensors, focusing on their ability for real-time environmental monitoring. A bibliometric evaluation was carried out, along with a study of the status of the existing e-tongue systems, how they worked, and their applications in different fields. The potential of e-tongue sensors to detect organic contaminants in aqueous environmental matrices is discussed, with a particular focus on EOC.  },

Drug residues, organic dyes, heavy metals, and other chemical pollutants not only cause environmental pollution, but also have a serious impact on food safety. Timely and systematic summary of the latest scientific advances is of great importance for the development of new detection technologies. In particular, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) can mimic antibodies, enzymes and other biological molecules to recognize, enrich, and separate contaminants, with specific recognition, selective adsorption, high affinity, and strong resistance characteristics. Therefore, MIPs have been widely used in chemical analysis, sensing, and material adsorption. In this review, we first describe the basic principles and production processes of molecularly imprinted polymers. Secondly, an overview of recent applications of molecularly imprinted polymers in sample pre-treatment, sensors, chromatographic separation, and mimetic enzymes is highlighted. Finally, a brief assessment of current technical issues and future trends in molecularly imprinted polymers is also presented. },

Functional group compatibility in an amide bond cleavage reaction with hydrazine was evaluated for 26 functional groups in the functional group evaluation (FGE) kit. Accurate and rapid evaluation of the compatibility of functional groups, such as nitrogen-containing heterocycles important in drug discovery research, will enhance the application of this reaction in drug discovery research. These data will be used for predictive studies of organic synthesis methods based on machine learning. In addition, these studies led to discoveries such as the unexpected positive additive effects of carboxylic acids, indicating that the FGE kit can propel serendipitous discoveries. },

 abstract = {  Aims 
This study aimed to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the relevant literature on the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and show its current status, hot spots, and development trends.    Methods 
The literature on IBD diagnosis was acquired from the Science Citation Index Expanded of the Web of Science Core Collection. Co-occurrence and cooperation relationship analysis of authors, institutions, countries, journals, references, and keywords in the literature were carried out through CiteSpace software and the Online Analysis platform of Literature Metrology. At the same time, the relevant knowledge maps were drawn, and the keywords cluster analysis and emergence analysis were performed.    Results 
14,742 related articles were included, showing that the number of articles in this field has increased in recent years. The results showed that PEYRIN-BIROULET L from the University Hospital of Nancy-Brabois was the author with the most cumulative number of articles. The institution with the most articles was Mayo Clin, and the United States was far ahead in the article output and had a dominant role. Keywords analysis showed that there was a total of 818 keywords, which were mainly focused on the research of related diseases caused or coexisted by IBD, such as colorectal cancer and autoimmune diseases, and the diagnosis and treatment methods of IBD. Emerging analysis showed that future research hotspots and trends might be the treatment of IBD and precision medicine.    Conclusion 
This research was the first bibliometric analysis of publications in the field of IBD diagnosis using visualization software and data information mining, and obtained the current status, hotspots, and development of this field. The future research hotspot might be the precision medicine of IBD, and the mechanism needed to be explored in depth to provide a theoretical basis for its clinical application.  },

Kernels of several varieties of wheat, rye and barley were found to have different resistance to fungi attack and ochratoxin A production, particularly in first step of fungus development on kernels. Zinc was stated to be a limiting factor of ochratoxin production. Viable sound kernels were very resistant against fungi. Dead (e.g. autoclaved) kernels were attacked by fungus very quickly. Varieties with stronger resistance to fungi invasion during storage were selected. },

The discovery of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial infections brought the idea that bacteria would no longer endanger human health. However, bacterial diseases still represent a worldwide treat. The ability of microorganisms to develop resistance, together with the indiscriminate use of antibiotics, is mainly responsible for this situation; thus, resistance has compelled the scientific community to search for novel therapeutics. In this scenario, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) provide a promising strategy against a wide array of pathogenic microorganisms, being able to act directly as antimicrobial agents but also being important regulators of the innate immune system. This review is an attempt to explore marine AMPs as a rich source of molecules with antimicrobial activity. In fact, the sea is poorly explored in terms of AMPs, but it represents a resource with plentiful antibacterial agents performing their role in a harsh environment. For the application of AMPs in the medical field limitations correlated to their peptide nature, their inactivation by environmental pH, presence of salts, proteases, or other components have to be solved. Thus, these peptides may act as templates for the design of more potent and less toxic compounds. },

The ongoing search for effective treatment of Acne vulgaris is concentrated, i.a., on natural peptides with antimicrobial properties. The aim of this work was the development of new amino acid derivatives with potential activity on dermal infections against selected microorganisms, including the facultative anaerobe C. acne. The peptides P1\u2013P6 were synthesized via Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis using Rink amide AM resin, analyzed by RP-HPLC-MS, FTIR, DPPH radical scavenging activity, and evaluated against C. acne and S. aureus, both deposited and non-deposited in BC. Peptides P1\u2013P6 presented a lack of cytotoxicity, antimicrobial activity, or antioxidative properties correlated with selected structural properties. P2 and P4\u2013P6 sorption in BC resulted in variable data, i.a., confirming the prospective topical application of these peptides in a BC carrier. },

In this contribution, we report on the solid-state-photodynamical properties and further applications of a low dimensional composite material composed by the luminescent trans-4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran (DCM) dye interacting with a two-dimensional-metal organic framework (2D-MOF), Al-ITQ-HB. Three different samples with increasing concentration of DCM are synthesized and characterized. The broad UV-visible absorption spectra of the DCM\/Al-ITQ-HB composites reflect the presence of different species of DCM molecules (monomers and aggregates). In contrast, the emission spectra are narrower and exhibit a bathochromic shift upon increasing the DCM concentration, in agreeance with the formation of adsorbed aggregates. Time-resolved picosecond (ps)-experiments reveal multi-exponential behaviors of the excited composites, further confirming the heterogeneous nature of the samples. Remarkably, DCM\/Al-ITQ-HB fluorescence is sensitive to vapors of electron donor aromatic amine compounds like aniline, methylaniline, and benzylamine due to a H-bonding-induced electron transfer (ET) process from the analyte to the surface-adsorbed DCM. These findings bring new insights on the photobehavior of a well-known dye when interacting with a 2D-MOF and its possible application in sensing aniline derivatives. },

The simplicity of fullerenes as assembled components provides attractive opportunities for basic understanding in self-assembly research. We applied in situ reactive methods to the self-assembly process of C60 molecules with melamine\/ethylenediamine components in solution, resulting in a novel type of fullerene assemblies, micron-sized two-dimensional, amorphous shape-regular objects, fullerene rosettes. ATR\u2013FTIR spectra, XPS, and TGA results suggest that the melamine\/ethylenediamine components strongly interact and\/or are covalently linked with fullerenes in the fullerene rosettes. The broad peak for layer spacing in the XRD patterns of the fullerene rosettes corresponds roughly to the interdigitated fullerene bilayer or monolayer of modified fullerene molecules. The fullerene rosettes are made from the accumulation of bilayer\/monolayer assemblies of hybridized fullerenes in low crystallinity. Prototype sensor systems were fabricated upon immobilization of the fullerene rosettes onto surfaces of a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), and selective sensing of formic acid was demonstrated as preliminary results for social-demanded toxic material sensing. The QCM sensor with fullerene rosette is categorized as one of the large-response sensors among reported examples. In selectivity to formic acids against basic guests (formic acid\/pyridine >30) or aromatic guests (formic acid\/toluene >110), the fullerene rosette-based QCM sensor also showed superior performance. },

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of the peptide structure (WKWK)2-KWKWK-NH2, P4 (C12)2-KKKK-NH2, P5 (KWK)2-KWWW-NH2, P6 (KK)2-KWWW-NH2 on their physicochemical properties. The thermogravimetric method (TG\/DTG) was used, which made it possible to observe the course of chemical reactions and phase transformations occurring during the heating of solid samples. Based on the DSC curves, the enthalpy of the processes occurring in the peptides was determined. The influence of the chemical structure of this group of compounds on their film-forming properties was determined using the Langmuir\u2013Wilhelmy trough method and was followed by molecular dynamics simulation. Evaluated peptides showed high thermal stability and the first significant mass loss occurred only at about 230 \u00b0C and 350 \u00b0C. The analysis of the compressibility coefficient of individual peptides indicates that all formed peptide monolayers were in the expanded liquid phase. Their maximum compressibility factor was less than 50.0 mN\/m. Its highest value of 42.7 mN\/m was achieved in a monolayer made of P4. The results obtained in molecular dynamic simulation indicate that non-polar side chains played an important role in the properties of the P4 monolayer, and the same applies to P5, except that a spherical effect was observed here. A slightly different behavior was observed for the P6 and P2 peptide systems, where the type of amino acids present had an influence. The obtained results indicate that the structure of the peptide affected its physicochemical and layer-forming properties. },

The Langmuir Wilhelmy method was used for the experiments. Based on the compressibility factor, it was determined that the monolayers formed of azolectin and peptides in the aqueous subphase are in the condensed liquid phase. At the boundary between the condensed and expanded liquid phases, there was a monolayer made of lecithin and P4, P5 or P6 in the aqueous subphase. In turn, the film consisting of lecithin alone (37.7 mN\/m) and lecithin and P2 (42.6 mN\/m) in the water subphase was in the expanded liquid phase. All peptides change, to varying degrees, the organization and packing of molecules in the monolayer, both those made of azolectin and of lecithin. The test results can be used for further research to design a system with the expected properties for specific organisms. },

The Langmuir-Blodgett method has attracted significant attention due to its ability to form nanostructured films from many materials with precise film composition and thickness control. The modern Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique has continually developed novel methods and materials to fabricate nanostructured thin films. However, Fatty acid films fabricated by the Langmuir-Blodgett are considered one of the most common, earliest, and most studied nanomaterials applied in different fields. Despite their popularity and recent advances, a contemporary review on this topic has not been available to summarize published literature. This study reviews prior research on fatty acid film literature incorporating Bibliometric Analysis from Scopus during 22 years (2002 \u2013 2023) to provide a comprehensive review concerning the significant contribution of the field, its trends, and applications. The results provide an overview of factors affecting the properties and application potential of fatty acids and a need for the extension of fatty acids-based hybrid compounds for practical applications. Also, the review suggests a trend in increase of the international research collaboration in the field of thin films.\r\nFor citation:\r\n Thi Thao Vu, Tri Duc Luong, Duc Cuong Nguyen, Vu-Toan Le, Thi Thu Thuy Bui, Duc Dong Tran, Thi Hoa Hoang, Duy Minh Vu, Berezin D.B.

Food ingredient fraud and economically motivated adulteration are emerging risks, but a comprehensive compilation of information about known problematic ingredients and detection methods does not currently exist. The objectives of this research were to collect such information from publicly available articles in scholarly journals and general media, organize into a database, and review and analyze the data to identify trends. The results summarized are a database that will be published in the US Pharmacopeial Convention's  Food Chemicals Codex , 8th edition, and includes 1305 records, including 1000 records with analytical methods collected from 677 references. Olive oil, milk, honey, and saffron were the most common targets for adulteration reported in scholarly journals, and potentially harmful issues identified include spices diluted with lead chromate and lead tetraoxide, substitution of Chinese star anise with toxic Japanese star anise, and melamine adulteration of high protein content foods. High\u2010performance liquid chromatography and infrared spectroscopy were the most common analytical detection procedures, and chemometrics data analysis was used in a large number of reports. Future expansion of this database will include additional publically available articles published before 1980 and in other languages, as well as data outside the public domain. The authors recommend in\u2010depth analyses of individual incidents. 
 Practical Application:\u2003  This report describes the development and application of a database of food ingredient fraud issues from publicly available references. The database provides baseline information and data useful to governments, agencies, and individual companies assessing the risks of specific products produced in specific regions as well as products distributed and sold in other regions. In addition, the report describes current analytical technologies for detecting food fraud and identifies trends and developments. },

\n\n\nHabitus is a logical and ethical Aristotelian concept that was first introduced to the Islamic world through the translation of Greek philosophical works into Arabic in the ninth century. Following its introduction and until the nineteenth century, thinkers and scholars of the Islamic world naturalized it creatively in various intellectual systems. In ethical usage, habitus is a disposition that, once acquired and well established through a process of accustoming, allows humans to perceive and act in certain ways without deliberation or reflection. This concept explained how humans transcended their inborn natures, and as such it was amenable to employment in manifold fields and contexts. The present article studies significant applications from the ninth to the nineteenth century by thinkers of the Islamic world, who fleshed out the Aristotelian concept and used it for their own purposes. Among other things, it shows that the two main trends of naturalization involved application of the concept to religious Islamic discourses and to the study of humans and their society, anticipating modern Western sociological usage.\n\n\n },

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinically approved procedure for targeting tumor cells. Though several different photosensitizers have been developed, there is still much demand for novel photosensitizers with improved properties. In this study we aim to characterize the accumulation, localization and dark cytotoxicity of the novel photosensitizers developed in\u2010house derivatives of porphyrazines ( pz I\u2010IV)  in primary murine neuronal cells, as well as to identify the concentrations at which  pz  still effectively induces death in glioma cells yet is nontoxic to nontransformed cells. The study shows that incubation of primary neuronal and glioma cells with  pz I\u2010IV  leads to their accumulation in both types of cells, but their rates of internalization, subcellular localization and dark toxicity differ significantly.  Pz II  was the most promising photosensitizer. It efficiently killed glioma cells while remaining nontoxic to primary neuronal cells. This opens up the possibility of evaluating  pz II  for experimental PDT for glioma.

 abstract = { Abstract   
Urothelial carcinoma associated 1\u03b1 (UCA1\u03b1) is a novel long non\u2010coding RNA (lncRNA) that regulates bladder cancer proliferation, migration, and invasion. The target genes of UCA1\u03b1 have, however, not been identified. To address this, a pCDNA3.1(+)\u2010UCA1\u03b1 over\u2010expression vector was transfected into UM\u2010UC\u20102 bladder cancer cells. Genes differentially expressed between pCDNA3.1(+)\u2010UCA1\u03b1 and pCDNA3.1(+) transfected cell were then detected by microarray and bioinformatics analysis. A total of 71 differentially expressed genes were identified, including 52 up\u2010regulated genes and 19 down\u2010regulated genes. As expected, the lncRNA UCA1\u03b1 expression level was significantly increased when compared to that of pCDNA3.1(+) transfected cells. The five most significantly up\u2010regulated and five most significantly down\u2010regulated genes were selected, and their expression levels were also assessed by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The mRNA and protein expression levels of FOXI3 and GSTA3 were found to be significantly increased, and those of MED18 and TEX101 were found to be significantly decreased. Gene ontology (GO) clustering identified several significant biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions, associated with lncRNA UCA1\u03b1 over\u2010expression. The differentially expressed genes were involved in several significant pathways as shown by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway clustering. Cell proliferation activity was significantly increased following overexpression of lncRNA UCA1\u03b1 increasing over culture time. The present study identifies, for the first time, potential target genes for lncRNA UCA1\u03b1 in bladder cancer, and provides a significant reference for studying the role of lncRNA UCA1\u03b1 in bladder cancer.  },

 Purpose: To detect IGF-1R on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a biomarker in the clinical development of a monoclonal human antibody, CP-751,871, targeting IGF-1R. Experimental Design: An automated sample preparation and analysis system for enumerating CTCs (Celltracks) was adapted for detecting IGF-1R positive CTCs with a diagnostic antibody targeting a different IGF-1R epitope to CP-751,871. This assay was utilized in three phase I trials of CP-751,871 as a single agent or with chemotherapy and was validated using cell lines and blood samples from healthy volunteers and patients with metastatic carcinoma. Results: There was no interference between the analytical and therapeutic antibodies. CP-751,871 was well tolerated as a single agent, and in combination with docetaxel or carboplatin and paclitaxel, at doses ranging from 0.05 mg\/kg to 20 mg\/kg. Eighty patients were enrolled on phase 1 studies of CP-751,871, with 47 (59%) patients having CTCs detected during the study. Prior to treatment 26 patients (33%) had CTCs, with 23 having detectable IGF-1R positive CTCs. CP-751,871 alone, and CP-751,871 with cytotoxic chemotherapy, decreased CTCs and IGF-1R positive CTCs; these increased towards the end of the 21-day cycle in some patients, falling again with retreatment. CTCs were commonest in advanced hormone refractory prostate cancer (11\/20). Detectable IGF-1R expression on CTCs before treatment with CP-751,871 and docetaxel was associated with a higher frequency of PSA decline by more than 50% (6\/10 vs 2\/8 patients). A relationship was observed between sustained falls in CTCs counts and PSA declines by more than 50%. Conclusions: IGF-1R expression is detectable by immunofluorescence on CTCs. These data support the further evaluation of CTCs in pharmacodynamic studies and patient selection, particularly in advanced prostate cancer.

The pentacyclic triterpenoids betulin and betulonic acid are promising sources of new biologically active compounds. Grafting them onto polymer matrices leads to the formation of effective dosage forms compared to the original drug. On the basis of betulin and betulonic acid, the synthesis of polymer structures with a fragment of triterpene in the side chain was carried out. New triterpene-containing polymer ensembles were obtained by the method of polymer-analogous transformations of copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone with N-(n-carboxy) phenylmaleimide and p-aminostyrene. By crosslinking the carboxyl groups of the copolymer of N-vinylpyrrolidone with N-(n-carboxy) phenylmaleimide with betulin hydroxyl groups and the reaction of the amino groups of the copolymer of N-vinyl pyrrolidone with p-aminopyrol with carboxyl groups of betulonic acid, polymer structures with polycyclic triterpene fragments are obtained. The resulting polymer ensembles have higher activity against melanoma compared to the original copolymers. A polymer based on a copolymer of N-vinylpyrrolidone with N-(n-carboxy) phenylmaleimide and betulin at a concentration of 40.48 \u03bcM inhibits 50% of MS cells, while 50% of MS cells die under the influence of 68.29 \u03bcM betulin. New triterpene-containing polymer ensembles are promising for the development of new biologically active polymer bioconjugates. },

Cycling stability is a key challenge for application of silicon (Si)-based composite anodes as the severe volume fluctuation of Si readily leads to fast capacity fading. The binder is a crucial component of the composite electrodes. Although only occupying a small amount of the total composite mass, the binder has major impact on the long-term electrochemical performance of Si-based anodes. In recent years, water-based binders including styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) have attracted wide research interest as eco-friendly and low-cost alternatives for the conventional poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) binder in Si anodes. In this study, Si-based composite anodes are fabricated by simple solid mixing of the active materials with subsequent addition of SBR and CMC binders. This approach bypasses the use of toxic and expansive organic solvents. The factors of binder, silicon, and graphite materials have been systematically investigated. It is found that the retained capacities of the anodes are more than 440 mAh\/g after 400 cycles. These results indicate that organic solvent free process is a facile strategy for producing high performance silicon\/graphite composite anodes. },

The construction of functional systems with nanosized parts would not possible by simple technology (nanotechnology). It can be handled by certain kinds of more sophisticated carpenter work or artistic architectonics (nanoarchitectonics). However, architecting materials in the nanoscale is not very simple because of various unexpected and uncontrollable thermal\/statistical fluctuations and mutual interactions. The latter factors inevitably disturb the interactions between component building blocks. Therefore, several techniques and actions, including the regulation of atomic\/molecular manipulation, molecular modification by organic chemistry, control of physicochemical interactions, self-assembly\/organization, and application of external physical stimuli, must be well combined. This short review describes the historical backgrounds and essences of nanoarchitectonics, followed by a brief introduction of recent examples related to nanoarchitectonics. These examples are categorized in accordance with their physical usages: (i) atom\/molecule control; (ii) devices and sensors; (iii) the other applications based on interfacial nanoarchitectonics. },

Purpose: To evaluate distress in newly diagnosed cancer patients.\nSubjects and Methods: Cross-sectional prospective study of 67 newly diagnosed patients at the Department of Pain management and Palliative Care, 108 Military Central Hospital, from August to October 2023. The patient's level of distress was assessed by the Distress Thermometer - DT and the Problem List (PL) of NCCN February 2022, Vietnamese version.\nResults: The average distress score among newly diagnosed cancer patients was 4.42 \u00b1 2.237, with 3% reporting no distress, 44.8% experiencing mild distress, and 52.2% reporting moderate to severe distress (\u2265 4 points). Common sources of distress among the participants included physical discomfort (94.0%), with 73.1% reporting sleep problems and 71.6% experiencing fatigue. Emotional challenges were prevalent as well (91.0%), with 49.3% reporting feelings of sadness and 47.8% experiencing anxiety. Additionally, concerns regarding self-care (53.7%) and financial worries (43.3%) were notable contributors to distress, accounting for 76.1% of the participants' concerns overall. The rate of moderate and severe distress in newly diagnosed cancer patients were statistically significantly related to age (more prevalent in patients\u00a0 under 60), gender (higher in females) education level (more in those with secondary school education or less), income (higher in those with below-average incomes), health insurance benefits (higher in patients with less comprehensive coverage). },

The calculated and experimental Raman spectra of the (EMI + )TFSI \u2212  ionic liquid, where EMI +  is the 1\u2010ethyl\u20103\u2010methylimidazolium cation and TFSI \u2212  the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion, have been investigated for a better understanding of the EMI +  and TFSI \u2212  conformational isomerism as a function of temperature. Characteristic Raman lines of the planar (p) and non\u2010planar (np) EMI +  conformers are identified using the reference (EMI + )Br \u2212  salt. The anion conformer of  C  2  symmetry is confirmed to be more stable than the  cis  ( C  1 ) one by 4.5 \u00b1 0.2 kJ mol \u22121 . At room temperature, the population of  trans  ( C  2 ) anions and np cations is 75 \u00b1 2% and 87 \u00b1 4%, respectively. Fast cooling quenches a metastable glassy phase composed of mainly  C  2  anion conformers and p cation conformers, whereas slow cooling gives a crystalline phase composed of  C  1  anion conformers and of np cation conformers.

Highly sensitive surface\u2010enhanced Raman scattering active substrate obtained by self\u2010assembly of silver nanocolloids (AgNCs) in the bilayer Langmuir\u2013Blodgett (LB) film of stearic acid (SA) has been reported. Rhodamine 6G (R6G) has been used as the probe molecule to test the efficacy of the  as prepared  substrate. Gigantic enhancement factors ~10 12  orders of magnitude have been estimated from the surface\u2010enhanced resonance Raman scattering [SER(R) S] spectrum of R6G, which proves that the  as prepared  substrate is superior or comparable with silver nanoparticle as dried AgNC solutions on microscopic slides. The optical properties of the  as prepared  substrates have been envisaged by ultraviolet\u2010visible absorption spectra, while their morphological features are mapped through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images. A correlation has been drawn between the SER(R) S efficacy and the corresponding FESEM and AFM images of the  as prepared  substrates. Electric field distributions around the aggregated AgNCs have been estimated with the aid of three\u2010dimensional finite difference time domain simulation studies. Localized surface plasmon coupling between the nanoaggregated geometries may be altered by lifting the LB film of SA at various surface pressures. Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. },

Raman spectroscopy has demonstrated immense promise as a molecular fingerprinting tool in biomedical diagnostics. However, the utility of conventional Raman scattering for ultrasensitive measurements of biofluids is limited by intrinsically weak signals and has spurred advances in and wider applications of plasmon\u2010enhanced measurements. Here, we propose a label\u2010free methodology that leverages drop coating deposition on a silver ink\u2010based plasmonic paper substrate with tunable hydrophobic attributes to combine two distinct sources of enhancement, namely, solute preconcentration and excitation of localized surface plasmons. The facile modulation of the hydrophobicity of the plasmonic silver paper facilitates investigations into the coffee\u2010ring effect that results from the interplay of contact line pinning, solvent evaporation, and capillary flow. We show that the Raman spectra acquired from the hydrated ring deposits show clear enhancement beyond that obtained from surface\u2010enhancement owing to the presence of the silver nanofilm. In light of the superior sensitivity and lack of substantive sample preparation requirements, our findings open the door for a complementary low\u2010cost paper\u2010based analytical device for molecular sensing. },

A facile procedure towards the fabrication of highly reproducible, large area surface\u2010enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) active substrates through integration of Langmuir\u2013Blodgett and self\u2010assembly technique has been reported. The plasmonic architectures of the substrates can be tuned at will to control the hot spots and hence the overall enhancements of SERS signal. The as\u2010prepared substrates of classes \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d incubated in gold nanocolloids show their respective efficacies as efficient SERS sensing scaffolds for detecting 4\u2010MPy molecule at ultrasensitive concentrations. Moreover, these substrates are unique in their kinds, where explicit or concomitant presence of protonated and deprotonated forms of 4\u2010MPy can be detected at trace concentrations. The substrates also exhibit remarkable spectral reproducibility and show early promise to overcome the \u201cSERS uncertainty principle\u201d. To our knowledge, this genre of SERS active substrates with facile control over plasmonics, is the first report of its kind and are expected to provide new direction towards successful fabrication of the next generation SERS sensing platforms. },

Fundamental physical chemical properties of a monolayer film comprised of the chiral, photopolymerizable phospholipid 1,2\u2010bis(10,12\u2010tricosadiynoyl)\u2010sn\u2010glycero\u20103\u2010phosphocholine (Diyne PC) and the impact of a model perfluorocarbon, perfluorotetradecanoic acid (PF), on these film properties have been investigated, both with and without UV photopolymerization. Enantiomerically pure Diyne PC formed compact, stable monolayers at the air\u2010water interface, exhibited typical phospholipid phase transitions in surface pressure\u2010area isotherms and yielded micron\u2010scale, linear domains upon film compression. Photopolymerized films were significantly more expanded in comparison with the unpolymerized films and the resulting domains had a spiral morphology with a strongly preferred spiral direction. Mixing Diyne PC with PF altered the isotherm behavior, with the principal effects being a significant reduction in the plateau region associated with the characteristic LE\u2010LC phase transition and no larger\u2010scale spiral domain formation in the monolayers of the mixed films. Results are discussed in the context of interactions between the two different film components and the tendency of perfluorinated surfactants to disperse condensed phase regions of phospholipid\u2010based monolayer films. Overall, the tendency of PF to disperse condensed regions of the film makes patterning of films in mixed phospholipid\u2010perfluorocarbon monolayers particularly difficult. },

 abstract = { Abstract   BACKGROUND 
Paraquat, a highly efficient herbicide, is widely used in agricultural practices throughout the world. However, paraquat residues in food pose a threat to human health. In order to develop a rapid and sensitive method, surface\u2010enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) coupled with gold nanoparticles was applied to analysis of paraquat in apple juice.    RESULTS 
Natural organic compounds (sugars and organic acids) in apple juice interfered with SERS measurement. Sample preparation was needed. Paraquat could be detected at concentrations as low as 0.02 and 0.1 \u00b5g mL \u2212 1  with the weak cation\u2010exchange solid\u2010phase extraction (WCX\u2010SPE) method and dilution method for sample preparation, respectively. For quantitative analysis, the  R 2 cv of the partial least\u2010squares regression model with the dilution method (0.939) was not as good as with the WCX\u2010SPE method (0.984), but the dilution method is much less costly, simpler and time saving. Satisfactory recovery values were obtained ranging from 94.73% to 114.81%, with the exception of 56.55% for the lowest concentration.    CONCLUSION 
This work showed that SERS combined with gold nanoparticles could determine paraquat in apple juice. As a simple, rapid and ultrasensitive method, it has great practical potential for detection of other contaminants in a variety of foods. \u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry  },

A simple and novel self-assembly based process is presented in this paper for the fabrication of gold triangular nanocavity arrays. This process combines nanosphere lithography (NSL) with some standard MEMS technologies. A carboxylated polystyrene (PS) nanosphere bilayer with a relatively large area is fabricated on silicon wafer as the starting template by spin-coating. Oxygen plasma etching, metal deposition and lifting-off of the PS upper layer are then orderly carried out for the formation of triangular space, which is made up of Cr film and the remaining PS nanoparticles. Then silicon etching is used to transfer the triangle pattern onto the silicon wafer. Finally, a 50 nm thick gold layer is deposited on the pattern to fabricate gold triangular nanocavity arrays. With this strategy, both the period and the cavity size can be adjusted independently. This will allow the tuning of the optical properties for desired application. },

 abstract = {
Drug delivery systems involving polymer therapeutics enhance drug potency by improved solubility and specificity and may assist in circumventing chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer (PC). We compared the effectiveness of the naturally occurring drug, betulinic acid (BA), alone and in a polymer conjugate construct of polyethylene glycol (PEG), (PEG\u2013BA), on PC cells (MIA PaCa-2), a normal cell line (Vero) and on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PEG\u2013BA, was tested for its effect on cell death, immunomodulation and chemoresistance-linked signalling pathways. The conjugate was significantly more toxic to PC cells (p < 0.001, IC50 of 1.35 \u00b1 0.11 \u00b5M) compared to BA (IC50 of 12.70 \u00b1 0.34 \u00b5M), with a selectivity index (SI) of 7.28 compared to 1.4 in Vero cells. Cytotoxicity was confirmed by increased apoptotic cell death. PEG\u2013BA inhibited the production of IL-6 by 4\u20135.5 fold compared to BA-treated cells. Furthermore, PEG\u2013BA treatment of MIA PaCa-2 cells resulted in the dysregulation of crucial chemoresistance genes such as WNT3A, TXNRD1, SLC2A1 and GATA3. The dysregulation of chemoresistance-associated genes and the inhibition of cytokines such as IL-6 by the model polymer construct, PEG\u2013BA, holds promise for further exploration in PC treatment. },

This article aims to provide an overview of broad range of applications of synchrotron scattering methods in the investigation of nanoscale materials. These scattering techniques allow the elucidation of the structure and dynamics of nanomaterials from sub-nm to micron size scales and down to sub-millisecond time ranges both in bulk and at interfaces. A major advantage of scattering methods is that they provide the ensemble averaged information under in situ and operando conditions. As a result, they are complementary to various imaging techniques which reveal more local information. Scattering methods are particularly suitable for probing buried structures that are difficult to image. Although, many qualitative features can be directly extracted from scattering data, derivation of detailed structural and dynamical information requires quantitative modeling. The fourth-generation synchrotron sources open new possibilities for investigating these complex systems by exploiting the enhanced brightness and coherence properties of X-rays. },

X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra for protein layers adsorbed at liquid interfaces in a Langmuir trough have been recorded for the first time. We studied the parkin protein (so-called E3 ubiquitin ligase), which plays an important role in pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. Parkin contains eight Zn binding sites, consisting of cysteine and histidine residues in a tetracoordinated geometry. Zn K-edge XANES spectra were collected in the following two series: under mild radiation condition of measurements (short exposition time) and with high X-ray radiation load. XANES fingerprint analysis was applied to obtain information on ligand environments around zinc ions. Two types of zinc coordination geometry were identified depending on X-ray radiation load. We found that, under mild conditions, local zinc environment in our parkin preparations was very similar to that identified in hemoglobin, treated with a solution of ZnCl2 salt. Under high X-ray radiation load, considerable changes in the zinc site structure were observed; local zinc environment appeared to be almost identical to that defined in Zn-containing enzyme alkaline phosphatase. The formation of a similar metal site in unrelated protein molecules, observed in our experiments, highlights the significance of metal binding templates as essential structural modules in protein macromolecules. },

A versatile and simple method is presented for the rapid fabrication of close\u2010packed colloidal 2D crystals with large domain sizes by floating and redeposition of colloidal monolayers at the air\/water interface. A detailed analysis of the particle surface transformation and packing during the individual steps of the monolayer fabrication process has been conducted. It was found that the quality of the monolayer depends on parameters like colloidal particle distribution on the initial substrate, subphase pH, and addition of surfactants. The floating monolayers could be transferred and stacked onto many substrate types, regardless of surface polarity, roughness, or curvature.

 abstract = { Abstract 
Polymeric antimicrobial peptide mimics are a promising alternative for the future management of the daunting problems associated with antimicrobial resistance. However, the development of successful antimicrobial polymers (APs) requires careful control of factors such as amphiphilic balance, molecular weight, dispersity, sequence, and architecture. While most of the earlier developed APs focus on random linear copolymers, the development of APs with advanced architectures proves to be more potent. It is recently developed multivalent bottlebrush APs with improved antibacterial and hemocompatibility profiles, outperforming their linear counterparts. Understanding the rationale behind the outstanding biological activity of these newly developed antimicrobials is vital to further improving their performance. This work investigates the physicochemical properties governing the differences in activity between linear and bottlebrush architectures using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Linear copolymers are more solvated, thermo\u2010responsive, and possess facial amphiphilicity resulting in random aggregations when interacting with liposomes mimicking  Escheria coli  membranes. The bottlebrush copolymers adopt a more stable secondary conformation in aqueous solution in comparison to linear copolymers, conferring rapid and more specific binding mechanism to membranes. The advantageous physicochemical properties of the bottlebrush topology seem to be a determinant factor in the activity of these promising APs. },

An anionic and a cationic bipolar amphiphile containing rigid biphenyl cores were synthesized. The compounds were dissolved in a mixture of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and water and pure water, respectively. When a solid substrate with a positively charged planar surface is immersed in the solution containing the negatively charged bipolar amphiphile, a monolayer of the amphiphile is adsorbed and due to its bipolar structure the surface charge is reversed. After rinsing in pure water the substrate is immersed in the solution containing the positively charged bipolar amphiphile. Again a monolayer is adsorbed but now the original surface charge is restored. By repeating both steps in a cyclic fashion alternating multilayer assemblies of both compounds are obtained. It is demonstrated that multilayer films, composed of at least 35 consecutively alternating layers, which corresponds to a total film thickness of 170 nm can be assembled. },

Our study commemorates this event by presenting a retrospective of the publications related to the use of mathematical tools for the analysis of economic, ecological, and environmental phenomena. We analyzed 1257 scientific publications using bibliometric techniques to examine the most productive and influential authors and their contributions in the economic, ecological, and environmental fields. Co-authorship among the top authors and countries, co-occurrence of the keywords, bibliographic coupling of the documents and authors, and author co-citation were analyzed by applying network analysis techniques using VOSviewer software, identifying the intellectual structure of the research and the collaborative networks in the fields. The results show that mathematics has grown impressively in terms of publication and citation. The contributions come from all over the world, but the majority are from the People\u2019s Republic of China and Spain. The results also show themes and trends in the economic, environmental, and ecological fields and a predominant use of mathematical tools in optimization processes in order to rigorously substantiate the decisions of investors and policymakers. Thus, our study offers support for any researcher to understand the current state of the art and develop a comprehensive understanding of journal publications. },

The amounts of antibiotics of anthropogenic origin released and accumulated in the environment are known to have a negative impact on local communities of microorganisms, which leads to disturbances in the course of the biodegradation process and to growing antimicrobial resistance. This mini-review covers up-to-date information regarding problems related to the omnipresence of antibiotics and their consequences for the world of bacteria. In order to understand the interaction of antibiotics with bacterial membranes, it is necessary to explain their interaction mechanism at the molecular level. Such molecular-level interactions can be probed with Langmuir monolayers representing the cell membrane. This mini-review describes monolayer experiments undertaken to investigate the impact of selected antibiotics on components of biomembranes, with particular emphasis on the role and content of individual phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). It is shown that the Langmuir technique may provide information about the interactions between antibiotics and lipids at the mixed film surface (\u03c0\u2013A isotherm) and about the penetration of the active substances into the phospholipid monolayer model membranes (relaxation of the monolayer). Effects induced by antibiotics on the bacterial membrane may be correlated with their bactericidal activity, which may be vital for the selection of appropriate bacterial consortia that would ensure a high degradation efficiency of pharmaceuticals in the environment. },

Among pollutants of emerging concern, endocrine disruptors (ED) have been shown to cause side effects in humans and animals. Bisphenol-A (BPA) is an ED by-product of the plastic industry and one of the chemicals with the highest volume produced yearly. Here, we studied the role of cholesterol in the BPA exposure effects over membrane models. We used Langmuir films of both neat lipid DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and cholesterol (Chol) and a binary mixture containing DPPC\/Chol, exposing it to BPA. We evaluate changes in the \u03c0-A isotherms and the PM\u2013IRRAS (polarization modulation\u2013infrared reflection adsorption spectroscopy) spectra. BPA exposure induced changes in the DPPC and Chol neat monolayers, causing mean molecular area expansion and altering profiles. However, at high surface pressure, the BPA was expelled from the air\u2013water interface. For the DPPC\/Chol mixture, BPA caused expansion throughout the whole compression, indicating that BPA is present at the monolayer interface. The PM\u2013IRRAS analysis showed that BPA interacted with the phosphate group of DPPC through hydrogen bonding, which caused the area\u2019s expansion. Such evidence might be biologically relevant to better understand the mechanism of action of BPA in cell membranes once phosphatidylcholines and Chol are found in mammalian membranes. },

This review will focus on micromachines and microrobots, which are objects at the micro-level with similar machine functions, as well as nano-level objects such as molecular machines and nanomachines. The paper will initially review recent examples of molecular machines and microrobots that are not limited to interfaces, noting the diversity of their functions. Next, examples of molecular machines and micromachines\/micro-robots functioning at the air-water interface will be discussed. The behaviors of molecular machines are influenced significantly by the specific characteristics of the air-water interface. By placing molecular machines at the air-water interface, the scientific horizon and depth of molecular machine research will increase dramatically. On the other hand, for microrobotics, more practical and advanced systems have been reported, such as the development of microrobots and microswimmers for environmental remediations and biomedical applications. The research currently being conducted on the surface of water may provide significant basic knowledge for future practical uses of molecular machines and microrobots. },

The anaerobic bacterium Propionibacterium acnes is believed to play an important role in the pathophysiology of the common skin disease acne vulgaris. Over the last 10 years our understanding of the taxonomic and intraspecies diversity of this bacterium has increased tremendously, and with it the realisation that particular strains are associated with skin health while others appear related to disease. This extensive review will cover our current knowledge regarding the association of P. acnes phylogroups, clonal complexes and sequence types with acne vulgaris based on multilocus sequence typing of isolates, and direct ribotyping of the P. acnes strain population in skin microbiome samples based on 16S rDNA metagenomic data. We will also consider how multi-omic and biochemical studies have facilitated our understanding of P. acnes pathogenicity and interactions with the host, thus providing insights into why certain lineages appear to have a heightened capacity to contribute to acne vulgaris development, while others are positively associated with skin health. We conclude with a discussion of new therapeutic strategies that are currently under investigation for acne vulgaris, including vaccination, and consider the potential of these treatments to also perturb beneficial lineages of P. acnes on the skin. },

Cutibacterium acnes is a member of the skin microbiota found predominantly in regions rich in sebaceous glands. It is involved in maintaining healthy skin and has long been considered a commensal bacterium. Its involvement in various infections has led to its emergence as an opportunist pathogen. Interactions between C. acnes and the human host, including the human skin microbiota, promote the selection of C. acnes strains capable of producing several virulence factors that increase inflammatory capability. This pathogenic property may be related to many infectious mechanisms, such as an ability to form biofilms and the expression of putative virulence factors capable of triggering host immune responses or enabling C. acnes to adapt to its environment. During the past decade, many studies have identified and characterized several putative virulence factors potentially involved in the pathogenicity of this bacterium. These virulence factors are involved in bacterial attachment to target cells, polysaccharide-based biofilm synthesis, molecular structures mediating inflammation, and the enzymatic degradation of host tissues. C. acnes, like other skin-associated bacteria, can colonize various ecological niches other than skin. It produces several proteins or glycoproteins that could be considered to be active virulence factors, enabling the bacterium to adapt to the lipophilic environment of the pilosebaceous unit of the skin, but also to the various organs it colonizes. In this review, we summarize current knowledge concerning characterized C. acnes virulence factors and their possible implication in the pathogenicity of C. acnes. },

 abstract = {  Scope 
The protective effect of fish consumption on the cardiovascular system has primarily been ascribed to n\u20103 fatty acids, but data investigating the vascular effects of fish protein consumption are scarce. This study aimed to investigate the vascular impact of fish protein in a mouse model of atherosclerosis.    Methods and results 
Male apoE null mice were fed a Western diet containing 20% fish (turbot) protein, casein, or soy protein, for 16 wk. Morphometric analysis of the aorta revealed that the atherosclerotic plaque area of fish protein fed mice was twofold larger than that in casein\u2010 or soy protein\u2010fed mice. The percentage area of calcification deposits in plaques of fish protein fed mice was higher (7.57%) than that in casein\u2010fed (2.86%) or soy protein\u2010fed (3.46%) mice, and fish protein fed mice exhibited higher plaque expression of CD68, CD36, and IL\u20106 than the other two groups. Fish protein intake was accompanied by increased serum concentrations of trimethylamine\u2010 N \u2010oxide (7.03 \u00b1 2.83 \u03bcmol\/L), as compared with casein (0.92 \u00b1 0.46 \u03bcmol\/L) and soy protein (1.32 \u00b1 0.54 \u03bcmol\/L) intake.    Conclusion 
The present data indicate adverse effects of fish protein on the vascular system, which could be attributable to the high serum trimethylamine\u2010 N \u2010oxide concentrations in these mice.  },

 abstract = { Abstract 
Lipid metabolic reprogramming is one of the important metabolic characteristics of cancer cells. As major components of lipids, fatty acids provide energy and material basis for cancer cell survival. Abnormal fatty acid metabolism has been found in many cancers. Fatty acid uptake, transport, and synthesis are closely related to the pathogenesis of cancer. Meanwhile, fatty acid changes in the membrane structure of cancer cells and signal transduction mediated by signaling lipids are also helping cancer cells survive in the changing microenvironment. Some of these enzymes and metabolites involved in fatty acid metabolism are emerging as unique cancer biomarkers. Multiple studies have shown that disordered fatty acids can regulate tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance. Therefore, targeting fatty acid metabolism has become a promising treatment strategy. Here, we mainly present metabolic alterations of fatty acids, the basic components of lipids, in cancer. We discuss the cancer treatment based on fatty acid and fatty acid metabolism. These may provide a basis for a better understanding of lipid metabolic reprogramming in cancer, and also provide new ideas for cancer biomarker search, drug development, and combination therapy. },

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been considered as potential therapeutic sources of future antibiotics because of their broad-spectrum activities and different mechanisms of action compared to conventional antibiotics. Although AMPs possess considerable benefits as new generation antibiotics, their clinical and commercial development still have some limitations, such as potential toxicity, susceptibility to proteases, and high cost of peptide production. In order to overcome those obstacles, extensive efforts have been carried out. For instance, unusual amino acids or peptido-mimetics are introduced to avoid the proteolytic degradation and the design of short peptides retaining antimicrobial activities is proposed as a solution for the cost issue. In this review, we focus on small peptides, especially those with less than twelve amino acids, and provide an overview of the relationships between their three-dimensional structures and antimicrobial activities. The efforts to develop highly active AMPs with shorter sequences are also described. },

Self-assembly has been recognised as a ubiquitous aspect of modern chemistry. Our understanding and applications of self-assembly are substantially based on what has been learned from biochemical systems. In this review, we describe various aspects of  self-assembly commencing with an account of the soft structures that are available by assembly of surfactant amphiphiles, which are important scientific and industrial materials. Variation of molecular design using rules defined by surfactant self-assembly permits synthesis of functional nanostructures in solution and at surfaces while increasing the strength of intermolecular interactions through \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, metal cation coordination and\/or hydrogen bonding leads to formation of highly complex bespoke nanostructured materials exemplified by DNA assemblies. We describe the origins of self-assembly involving aggregation of lipid amphiphiles and how this subject has been expanded to include other highly advanced chemical systems. },

This review focuses on the chemical transformations used to functionalize BA\/BN\/BoA\/HBA in order to obtain new derivatives with improved biological activity, covering the period since 2013 to 2018. It is divided by the main chemical transformations reported in the literature, including amination, esterification, alkylation, sulfonation, copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition, palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling, hydroxylation, and aldol condensation reactions. In addition, the synthesis of heterocycle-fused BA\/HBA derivatives and polymer\u2012BA conjugates are also addressed. The new derivatives are mainly used as antitumor agents, but there are other biological applications such as antimalarial activity, drug delivery, bioimaging, among others. },

Dendrons consisting of two phosphonate functions and three oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) chains grafted on a central phenoxyethylcarbamoylphenoxy group were synthesized and investigated as Langmuir monolayers at the surface of water. The OEG chain in the para position was grafted with a t-Bu end-group, a hydrocarbon chain, or a partially fluorinated chain. These dendrons are models of structurally related OEG dendrons that were found to significantly improve the stability of aqueous dispersions of iron oxide nanoparticles when grafted on their surface. Compression isotherms showed that all OEG dendrons formed liquid-expanded Langmuir monolayers at large molecular areas. Further compression led to a transition ascribed to the solubilization of the OEG chains in the aqueous phase. Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) provided evidence that the dendrons fitted with hydrocarbon chains formed liquid-expanded monolayers throughout compression, whilst those fitted with fluorinated end-groups formed crystalline-like domains, even at large molecular areas. Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dendron molecules were partially miscible in monolayers. The deviations to ideality were larger for the dendrons fitted with a fluorocarbon end-group chain than for those fitted with a hydrocarbon chain. Brewster angle microscopy and atomic force microscopy supported the view that the dendrons were ejected from the phospholipid monolayer during the OEG conformational transition and formed crystalline domains on the surface of the monolayer. },

Cerium and its derivatives have been used as remedies for wounds since the early 20th century. Cerium nitrate has attracted most attention in the treatment of deep burns, followed later by reports of its antimicrobial properties. Its ability to mimic and replace calcium is presumed to be a major mechanism of its beneficial action. However, despite some encouraging results, the overall data are somewhat confusing with seemingly the same compounds yielding opposing results. Despite this, cerium nitrate is currently used in wound treatment in combination with silver sulfadiazine as Flammac\u00e9rium. Cerium oxide, especially in nanoparticle form (Nanoceria), has lately captured much interest due to its antibacterial properties mediated via oxidative stress, leading to an increase of published reports. The properties of Nanoceria depend on the synthesis method, their shape and size. Recently, the green synthesis route has gained a lot of interest as an alternative environmentally friendly method, resulting in production of effective antimicrobial and antifungal nanoparticles. Unfortunately, as is the case with antibiotics, emerging bacterial resistance against cerium-derived nanoparticles is a growing concern, especially in the case of bacterial biofilm. However, diverse strategies resulting from better understanding of the biology of cerium are promising. The aim of this paper is to present the progress to date in the use of cerium compounds as antimicrobials in clinical applications (in particular wound healing) and to provide an overview of the mechanisms of action of cerium at both the cellular and molecular level. },

It provides not only direct visualization of biological structures and processes, but also the capability of drug delivery systems regarding the target therapy. Conventional fluorescent probes are mainly based on monomer emission which has two distinguishing shortcomings in practice: small Stokes shifts and short lifetimes. Compared with monomer-based emission, excimer-based fluorescent probes have large Stokes shifts and long lifetimes which benefit biological applications. Recent progress in excimer-based fluorescent sensors (organic small molecules only) for biological applications are highlighted in this review, including materials and mechanisms as well as their representative applications. The progress suggests that excimer-based fluorescent probes have advantages and potential for bioanalytical applications. },

Wilson\u2019s disease causes copper accumulation in the liver and extrahepatic organs. The available therapies aim to lower copper levels by various means. However, a potent drug that can repair the damaged liver and brain tissue is needed. Silymarin has hepatoprotective, antioxidant, and cytoprotective properties. However, poor oral bioavailability reduces its efficacy. In this study, a \u201cthin film hydration method\u201d was used for synthesizing silymarin-encapsulated liposome nanoparticles (SLNPs) and evaluated them against copper toxicity, associated liver dysfunction and neurobehavioral abnormalities in Wistar rats. After copper toxicity induction, serological and behavioral assays were conducted to evaluate treatment approaches. Histological examination of the diseased rats revealed severe hepatocyte necrosis and neuronal vacuolation. These cellular degenerations were mild in rats treated with SLNPs and a combination of zinc and SLNPs (ZSLNPs). SLNPs also decreased liver enzymes and enhanced rats\u2019 spatial memory significantly (p = 0.006) in the diseased rats. During forced swim tests, SLNPs treated rats exhibited a 60-s reduction in the immobility period, indicating reduced depression. ZSLNPs were significantly more effective than traditional zinc therapy in decreasing the immobility period (p = 0.0008) and reducing liver enzymes, but not in improving spatial memory. Overall, SLNPs enhanced oral silymarin administration and managed copper toxicity symptoms. },

Transforming solar energy into chemical bonds is a promising and viable way to store solar energy. Porphyrins are natural light-capturing antennas, and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is an effective, artificially synthesized organic semiconductor. Their excellent complementarity has led to a growing number of research papers on porphyrin\/g-C3N4 hybrids for solar energy utilization. This review highlights the recent progress in porphyrin\/g-C3N4 composites, including: (1) porphyrin molecules\/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts connected via noncovalent or covalent interactions, and (2) porphyrin-based nanomaterials\/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts, such as porphyrin-based MOF\/g-C3N4, porphyrin-based COF\/g-C3N4, and porphyrin-based assembly\/g-C3N4 heterojunction nanostructures. Additionally, the review discusses the versatile applications of these composites, including artificial photosynthesis for hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction, and pollutant degradation. Lastly, critical summaries and perspectives on the challenges and future directions in this field are also provided. },

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases worldwide with varying etiological factors. The considerable change in daily life or adoption of a modern lifestyle, including changing eating habits from conventional to modern high-energy foods, results in CVD. In addition to several factors, dietary modification is recommended to reduce CVD prevalence. Omega-3 fatty acids (\u03c9-3 FAs) derived from various sources are beneficial for preventing CVD. This comprehensive review was undertaken to determine the dietary sources of \u03c9-3 FAs and their impacts on the health of cardiovascular patients. Using keywords such as cardiovascular diseases, \u03c9-3 FAs, and modern lifestyle, the literature was searched from PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, and the most recent relevant findings were discussed and cited in this article. The results show how dietary sources of \u03c9-3 FAs positively impact human health regarding cardio protection. Furthermore, the data also provided pieces of evidence that the mechanism(s) by which Omega-3 fatty acids decrease CVD incidence help design new therapeutic strategies against the onset or treatment of CVD. In addition, dietary behavior, its importance, and the role that \u03c9-3 FAs play in CVD in Gulf countries, mainly Saudi Arabia, are also discussed. The outcomes of this study concluded that much research has been done on the positive role of \u03c9-3 FAs in lowering CVD incidence. Nevertheless, there is a need for device-specific recommendations of \u03c9-3 FAs supplementation according to the region, as risk factors involved in the onset of CVD vary from region to region. },

The impact of in-plane and perpendicular magnetic fields on the spatial arrangement of superparamagnetic nanospheres is explored. We utilize nanosphere self-organization methods like Spin Coating and Drop-Casting in the presence of magnetic fields. In this way, the additional parameter of the long range magnetic dipolar interactions is introduced to the competing nanosphere\u2013surface and nanosphere\u2013nanosphere interactions, which control order and agglomeration. We present a comparative analysis of the self-assembly characteristics with respect to the different methods and the effect of the applied field in different directions. Under zero field perfect hexagonal arrays can be obtained by spin coating. Parallel applied fields tend to create directional patterns, while perpendicular favor 3D-accumulation. },

Screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) bear great potential in the detection of biomarker in clinical samples with low sample consumption. However, modification of electrode surfaces to improve the anti-interference ability and sensitivity is highly desirable for direct electroanalysis of whole blood samples. Here, a reliable and miniaturized electrochemical sensor is demonstrated based on SPCE equipped with vertically-ordered mesoporous silica-nanochannel film (VMSF). To achieve stable binding of VMSF and improve the electrocatalytic performance, electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ErGO) is applied as a conductive adhesion layer, that is in situ reduced from GO nanosheets during fast growth (less than 10 s) of amino groups modified VMSF (NH2-VMSF) using electrochemically assisted self-assembly (EASA). In comparison with bare SPCE, NH2-VMSF\/ErGO\/SPCE exhibits decreased oxidation potential of uric acid (UA) by 147 mV owing to significant electrocatalytic ability of ErGO. The dual signal amplification based on electrocatalysis of ErGO and enrichment of nanochannels leads to enhanced peak current by 3.9 times. Thus, the developed NH2-VMSF\/ErGO\/SPCE sensor enables sensitive detection of UA in the range from 0.5 \u03bcM to 180 \u03bcM with a low limit of detection (LOD, 129 nM, S\/N = 3). Owing to good anti-fouling ability and high selectivity of the sensor, direct and rapid detection of UA in human whole blood is realized with very low sample consumption (50 \u03bcL). },

In this study, a sulfonation approach using chlorosulfonic acid (CSA) to prepare cellulose sulfate nanofibers (CSNFs) from raw jute fibers is demonstrated. Both elemental sulfur content and zeta potential in the CSNFs are found to increase with increasing CSA content used. However, the corresponding crystallinity in the CSNFs decreases with the increasing amount of CSA used due to degradation of cellulose chains under harsh acidic conditions. The ammonium adsorption results from the CSNFs with varying degrees of sulfonation were analyzed using the Langmuir isotherm model, and the analysis showed a very high maximum ammonium adsorption capacity (41.1 mg\/g) under neutral pH, comparable to the best value from a synthetic hydrogel in the literature. The high ammonium adsorption capacity of the CSNFs was found to be maintained in a broad acidic range (pH = 2.5 to 6.5). },

 abstract = { Abstract 
Organic molecules store the energy of absorbed light in the form of charge-neutral molecular excitations \u2013 Frenkel excitons. Usually, in amorphous organic materials, excitons are viewed as quasiparticles, localized on single molecules, which diffuse randomly through the structure. However, the picture of incoherent hopping is not applicable to some classes of molecular aggregates \u2013 assemblies of molecules that have strong near-field interaction between electronic excitations in the individual subunits. Molecular aggregates can be found in nature, in photosynthetic complexes of plants and bacteria, and they can also be produced artificially in various forms including quasi-one dimensional chains, two-dimensional films, tubes, etc. In these structures light is absorbed collectively by many molecules and the following dynamics of molecular excitation possesses coherent properties. This energy transfer mechanism, mediated by the coherent exciton dynamics, resembles the propagation of electromagnetic waves through a structured medium on the nanometer scale. The absorbed energy can be transferred resonantly over distances of hundreds of nanometers before exciton relaxation occurs. Furthermore, the spatial and energetic landscape of molecular aggregates can enable the funneling of the exciton energy to a small number of molecules either within or outside the aggregate. In this review we establish a bridge between the fields of photonics and excitonics by describing the present understanding of exciton dynamics in molecular aggregates. },

Covalent organic frameworks are a class of crystalline porous polymers that integrate molecular building blocks into periodic structures and are usually synthesized using two-component [1+1] condensation systems comprised of one knot and one linker. Here we report a general strategy based on multiple-component [1+2] and [1+3] condensation systems that enable the use of one knot and two or three linker units for the synthesis of hexagonal and tetragonal multiple-component covalent organic frameworks. Unlike two-component systems, multiple-component covalent organic frameworks feature asymmetric tiling of organic units into anisotropic skeletons and unusually shaped pores. This strategy not only expands the structural complexity of skeletons and pores but also greatly enhances their structural diversity. This synthetic platform is also widely applicable to multiple-component electron donor\u2013acceptor systems, which lead to electronic properties that are not simply linear summations of those of the conventional [1+1] counterparts. },

Two-dimensional polymeric nanosheets have recently gained much attention, particularly top-down nanosheets such as graphene and metal chalcogenides originating from bulk-layered mother materials. Although molecule-based bottom-up nanosheets manufactured directly from molecular components can exhibit greater structural diversity than top-down nanosheets, the bottom-up nanosheets reported thus far lack useful functionalities. Here we show the design and synthesis of a bottom-up nanosheet featuring a photoactive bis(dipyrrinato)zinc(II) complex motif. A liquid\/liquid interfacial synthesis between a three-way dipyrrin ligand and zinc(II) ions results in a multi-layer nanosheet, whereas an air\/liquid interfacial reaction produces a single-layer or few-layer nanosheet with domain sizes of >10\u2009\u03bcm on one side. The bis(dipyrrinato)zinc(II) metal complex nanosheet is easy to deposit on various substrates using the Langmuir\u2013Sch\u00e4fer process. The nanosheet deposited on a transparent SnO 2  electrode functions as a photoanode in a photoelectric conversion system, and is thus the first photofunctional bottom-up nanosheet. },

This cross\u2010sectional study aimed to identify the impact of multimorbidity on self\u2010reported sarcopenia and compare the differences in the prevalence and associated factors of sarcopenia in community\u2010dwelling older adults with and without multimorbidity. We enrolled 876 community\u2010dwelling older adults in South Korea. Multimorbidity was defined as the coexistence of two or more chronic diseases, and sarcopenia was evaluated using the Strength, Assistance in walking, Rising from a chair, Climbing stairs, and Falling Questionnaire. Binomial logistic regression analyses were performed. Our study revealed that the prevalence of sarcopenia was significantly higher (43.5%) in older adults with multimorbidity than in those without multimorbidity (20.8%). This finding underscores the significant impact of multimorbidity on sarcopenia. We also found that poor perceived health status was the strongest predictor of sarcopenia in older adults with multimorbidity, while oldest\u2010old age (\u2265\u200985\u2009years) was the strongest predictor of sarcopenia in those without multimorbidity. Large prospective cohort studies using objective sarcopenia screening tools are needed to demonstrate the synergistic effects of multimorbidity and sarcopenia on health outcomes among community\u2010dwelling older adults. },

Graphite oxide sheet, now referred to as graphene oxide (GO), is the product of chemical oxidation and exfoliation of graphite powders that was first synthesized over a century ago. Interest in this old material has resurged in recent years, especially after the discovery of graphene, as GO is considered a promising precursor for the bulk production of graphene-based materials. GO sheets are single atomic layers that can readily extend up to tens of microns in lateral dimension. Therefore, their structure bridges the typical length scales of both chemistry and materials science. GO can be viewed as an unconventional type of soft material as it carries the characteristics of polymers, colloids, membranes, and as highlighted in this review, amphiphiles. GO has long been considered hydrophilic due to its excellent water dispersity, however, our recent work revealed that GO sheets are actually amphiphilic with an edge-to-center distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains. Thus, GO can adhere to interfaces and lower interfacial energy, acting as surfactant. This new property insight helps to better understand GO\u2019s solution properties which can inspire novel material assembly and processing methods such as for fabricating thin films with controllable microstructures and separating GO sheets of different sizes. In addition, GO can be used as a surfactant sheet to emulsify organic solvents with water and disperse insoluble materials such as graphite and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in water, which opens up opportunities for creating functional hybrid materials of graphene and other \u03c0-conjugated systems. },

 abstract = { Abstract \n               
The history of the development of potentiometric sensors over the past century demonstrates progress in constructing single, discrete (i.e., separate, to distinguish from sensor arrays) ion sensors, which have been made as selective as possible. Only a few types reveal high selectivity. However, easy measurement procedure, with low cost and availability, give rise to the search for new ways for their successful application. The present document describes a new concept for application of potentiometric multisensor systems, viz., sensor arrays for solution analysis, and the performance of this new analytical tool - the \"electronic tongue\". The electronic tongue is a multisensor system, which consists of a number of low-selective sensors and uses advanced mathematical procedures for signal processing based on the pattern recognition (PARC) and\/or multivariate analysis [artificial neural networks (ANNs), principal component analysis (PCA), etc.]. Definitions of the multisensor systems and their parameters are suggested. Results from the application of the electronic tongue, both for quantitative and qualitative analysis of different mineral water and wine samples, are presented and discussed. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
The use of graphene oxide (GO) has become widespread due to its advantageous properties for applications in medical devices, including cell scaffolds and sensors. Investigations on the spectroscopic and electrochemical features of nanostructured cell scaffolds may be of interest to design novel scaffolds architectures aimed at understanding their interactions with healthy and cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the interactions between liver cancer cells and two GO\u2010containing scaffold platforms, namely: cells membrane models containing GO in the form of Langmuir\u2013Blodgett films, and GO\u2010modified biodegradable polycaprolactone nanofibers. Sum\u2010frequency generation spectroscopy revealed the presence and formation of an expanded phospholipid monolayer underneath GO, while scanning electron microscopy images revealed the morphology of the cells on the different surfaces. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was employed to evaluate the charge transfer resistance in different nanostructured scaffolds containing liver cancer cells. The nanosystems developed here can be applied to study the interactions between cells on polymer nanofibers and Langmuir\u2013Blodgett films modified with GO for regenerative medicine. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
Betulin, a natural triterpene possessing a wide range of biological activities, has been modified via Steglich esterification to produce a methacrylate derivative capable of participating in radical polymerization. The modification is intended to increase the solubility of betulin, which is almost insoluble in water, by incorporating into the composition of an amphiphilic copolymer. The resulting solubility of betulin in water increased from 8\u00b710 \u22125 \u2009mg\/mL to more than 10\u2009mg\/mL per betulin. For this, well\u2010defined biocompatible thermoresponsive copolymers with high betulin content have been synthesized through the conventional and RAFT copolymerizations of betulin methacrylate (BeMA) with methoxy oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (MOEGMA). BeMA was more reactive in the BeMA\u2010MOEGMA pair; the resulting copolymers were slightly enriched with BeMA units (r 1 \u2009=\u20091.70, r 2 \u2009=\u20090.93). The copolymers exhibited LCST\u2010type behavior. LCST was tuned by balancing the hydrophobic betulin and hydrophilic OEG fragments. The molecular weight characteristics of polymers and their behavior in aqueous and organic solutions have been studied. Copolymers obtained by conventional polymerization had lower cloud points than RAFT copolymers of the same composition. The copolymers are characterized by low critical micelle concentrations that decrease as the BeMA fraction in the copolymers increases. RAFT copolymers were shown to form unimolecular micelles resistant to dissociation, which is promising for their use in targeted drug delivery. },

Surface properties of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) coated with the ternary monolayers of the phospholipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A (CsA), and the antioxidant lauryl gallate (LG) were examined. The films were deposited, by means of the Langmuir\u2013Blodgett (LB) technique, on activated by air low temperature plasma PET plates (PETair). Their topography and surface chemistry were determined with the help of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), respectively, while wettability was evaluated by the contact angle measurements. Then, the surface free energy and its components were calculated from the Lifshitz\u2013van der Waals\/Acid\u2013Base (LWAB) approach. The AFM imaging showed that the Langmuir monolayers were transferred effectively and yielded smoothing of the PETair surface. Mass spectrometry confirmed compatibility of the quantitative and qualitative compositions of the monolayers before and after the transfer onto the substrate. Moreover, the molecular arrangement in the LB films and possible mechanisms of DOPC-CsA-LG interactions were determined. The wettability studies provided information on the type and magnitude of the interactions that can occur between the biocoatings and the liquids imitating different environments. It was found that the changes from open to closed conformation of CsA molecules are driven by the hydrophobic environment ensured by the surrounding DOPC and LG molecules. This process is of significance to drug delivery where the CsA molecules can be released directly from the biomaterial surface by passive diffusion. The obtained results showed that the chosen techniques are complementary for the characterization of the molecular organization of multicomponent LB films at the polymer substrate as well as for designing biocompatible coatings with precisely defined wettability. },

Endocytosis, phagocytosis, and macropinocytosis are fundamental processes that enable cells to sample their environment, eliminate pathogens and apoptotic bodies, and regulate the expression of surface components. While a great deal of effort has been devoted over many years to understanding the proteins involved in these processes, the important contribution of phospholipids has only recently been appreciated. This review is an attempt to collate and analyze the rapidly emerging evidence documenting the role of phospholipids in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, phagocytosis, and macropinocytosis. A primer on phospholipid biosynthesis, catabolism, subcellular distribution, and transport is presented initially, for reference, together with general considerations of the effects of phospholipids on membrane curvature and charge. This is followed by a detailed analysis of the critical functions of phospholipids in the internalization processes and in the maturation of the resulting vesicles and vacuoles as they progress along the endo-lysosomal pathway. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
Traditional chromatographic separation systems are disadvantaged by low flow rates, a high pressure drop across the column, low capacity and poor reusability. Searching for more efficient separation systems we introduced the use of a ceramic monolith as robust support in bioseparations. A coating consisting of  l \u2010asparagine as ligand, poly( l \u2010lysine) as spacer arm and a commercial poly(ethylene acrylic acid) film forming copolymer network (Michem 4983\u201040R) was developed as a coating for these ceramic monoliths. Poly( l \u2010lysine) was synthesized by ring\u2010opening polymerization of \u03b5\u2010trifluoroacetyl\u2010 l \u2010lysine  N \u2010carboxyanhydride and coupled to a commercial film\u2010forming poly(ethylene acrylic acid) network. This construct was then \u2018decorated\u2019 with  l \u2010asparagine via the terminal amino functional groups of poly(L\u2010lysine) and coated onto the ceramic monolith to selectively bind  l \u2010asparaginase. Adsorption\/elution experiments showed reversible binding between  l \u2010asparagine and  l \u2010asparaginase, and the subsequent release of  l \u2010asparaginase, and between 83% and 94% of the active enzyme was recovered by elution with  d \u2010asparagine and NaCl solutions. The functional activity of the eluted  l \u2010asparaginase was verified by a Nessler's assay. While traditional separation processes (adsorption and elution) using gel bead packings take many hours, the ceramic monolith system achieves the same of level of separation in about 1\u2009h. This new system served as a proof of concept for its application in protein separation and purification. This work paves the way to a better understanding of the use of ceramic monoliths as stationary phase coated with a stable polymer construct for more robust and efficient supports in affinity chromatography. \u00a9 2020 Society of Industrial Chemistry },

We present here a brief review of direct force measurements between hydrophobic surfaces in aqueous solutions. For almost 70 years, researchers have attempted to understand the hydrophobic effect (the low solubility of hydrophobic solutes in water) and the hydrophobic interaction or force (the unusually strong attraction of hydrophobic surfaces and groups in water). After many years of research into how hydrophobic interactions affect the thermodynamic properties of processes such as micelle formation (self-assembly) and protein folding, the results of direct force measurements between macroscopic surfaces began to appear in the 1980s. Reported ranges of the attraction between variously prepared hydrophobic surfaces in water grew from the initially reported value of 80\u2013100 \u00c5 to values as large as 3,000 \u00c5. Recent improved surface preparation techniques and the combination of surface force apparatus measurements with atomic force microscopy imaging have made it possible to explain the long-range part of this interaction (at separations >200 \u00c5) that is observed between certain surfaces. We tentatively conclude that only the short-range part of the attraction (<100 \u00c5) represents the true hydrophobic interaction, although a quantitative explanation for this interaction will require additional research. Although our force-measuring technique did not allow collection of reliable data at separations <10 \u00c5, it is clear that some stronger force must act in this regime if the measured interaction energy curve is to extrapolate to the measured adhesion energy as the surface separation approaches zero (i.e., as the surfaces come into molecular contact). },

\n            Photosystem II (PSII) is a photo-oxidoreductase that harnesses light energy to use water to make fuel. Water oxidation occurs at a metal cluster in the active site called the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). Understanding PSII function has provided design principles for synthetic solar fuel catalysts; however, the details of water oxidation are obscured by the multiple states through which the mechanism proceeds, differences between species, and lability of the OEC. To better understand PSII function, we solved its structure from\n             Synechocystis \n            sp. PCC 6803. We observe significant differences compared with PSII from thermophilic cyanobacteria that highlight the need for reexamination of previous data using this structure for interpretation.

Polylysine-containing peptides are found to affect membrane protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol kinases, and adenylate cyclase. Poly(L-lysine), poly(D-lysine), random copolymers of lysine and serine or lysine and alanine, and poly(L-ornithine) produced large increases in the in vitro phosphorylation of some membrane proteins present in Xenopus laevis oocyte membranes. Poly(L-arginine) did not cause a similar stimulation. In these membranes the phosphorylation of polydisperse protein of approximately 25 kDa was also greatly increased by 1 mM spermine and spermidine, by 10 microM histone H1, or by 200 microM peptide containing the 14-residue sequence at the carboxyl terminus of the human c-Ki-ras 2 gene product, which has eight lysines. Similar specific stimulation of protein phosphorylation was observed with membranes of NG-108-15 nerve cells in culture. Polylysine peptides, including the c-Ki-ras 2 segment, also stimulate the in vitro phosphorylation of membrane inositolphospholipids, to produce mainly phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and less phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Polylysine also alters the activity of oocyte adenylate cyclase, assayed in the presence of either F- or 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate. },

The continuous spread of resistance genes among bacterial populations, in particular in hospital setting, threatens the advances of our medical systems and already costs more than 1 million lives per year. Antimicrobial polymers (APs) are a promising type of materials to counteract these developments, as they are non\u2010susceptible toward resistance development, and even target resistant bacteria. We herein show the synthesis of an arginine\u2010containing monomer and its polymerization via photo\u2010induced reversible addition\u2010fragmentation chain\u2010transfer polymerization. The synthesis is straightforward, and the macromolecules possess two charged functions (i.e., guanidinium and ammonium) per repeating unit after deprotection. Assessment of the biological activity reveals that polymers inhibit the growth of methicillin\u2010resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) while being relatively inactive against tested Gram\u2010negative strains. Surprisingly, among the tested polymers, the homopolymer of the arginine\u2010derived monomer is the best\u2010performing material, even though it possesses no notable hydrophobic units. Toxicity tests against red blood cells and other mammalian cells show a good biocompatibility of polymers, leading to an overall excellent selectivity. Using membrane models, the mechanism of action was found to be membrane disruption. The good selectivity of the herein presented polymer for MRSA makes them promising materials for the development of therapeutic agents against such infections. },

This simple process is also a robust one, being less sensitive to external parameters (ambient pressure, temperature, humidity, vibrations). The most interesting feature of the concave-shape-pattern unit cell (350 \u03bcm \u00d7 400 \u03bcm \u00d7 3 \u03bcm) of this crystal is the presence of triangular prisms at its border, each prism having a one-dimensional sphere array at its top edge. The high-quality ordered single layer found inside of each unit cell presents the super-prism effect and left-handed behavior. Wider yet elongated deposits with ordered walls and disordered top surfaces were formed under the fabric knots. Rectangular patterning was obtained even for 20 \u03bcm PS spheres. Polyester fabrics with other opening geometries and sizes (~300\u20131000 \u03bcm) or with higher fiber elasticity also allowed the formation of similar PCCs, some having curved prismatic walls. A higher colloid concentration (10\u201320%) induces the formation of thicker walls with fiber-negative replica morphology. Additionally, thick-wall PCCs (~100 \u03bcm) with semi-cylindrical morphology were obtained using SiO2 sub-microspheres and a wavy fabric. The colloidal pattern was used as a lithographic mask for natural lithography and as a template for the synthesis of triangular-prism-shaped inverted opals. },

In this study, a combined technique of bibliometric and social network analysis was applied on research articles, related to the application of nano-adsorbents for cobalt removal from wastewater, published in Scopus database up to 2020. The results revealed that the first relative research article appeared in the Scopus database in the year 2002. The total output of research articles reached 214 in the year 2020. Published research articles of the years 2014\u20132020, added up to 83.6% of total articles. King Saud University of Saudi Arabia, Chinese Academy of Science, and LUT University of Finland were found to serve as the gatekeepers who control information flows in the network of the most prolific institutions, while cooperation between China, Saudi Arabia, and United States was also identified. On average, the most prolific authors cooperated with five others, while the top 10 cited publications appeared to represent a sparse and weakly interconnected network of co-authors. Graphene oxide was the most prominent nano-adsorbent among the top 10 cited publications, and their respective co-citations network visualization helped in capturing the value of certain citations to the evolution of the research on the topic, putting thus scientific work impact assessment to a different perspective. },

Hydroxyapatite and b-tricalcium phosphate have been clinically applied as artificial bone materials due to their high biocompatibility. The development of artificial bones requires the verification of safety and efficacy through animal experiments; however, from the viewpoint of animal welfare, there is necessary to reduce the number of animal experiments. In this study, we utilized machine learning to construct a model that estimates the bone-forming ability of bioceramics from material fabrication conditions, material properties, and in vivo experimental conditions. We succeeded in constructing the two models as follows: \u2018Model 1\u2019, which predicts material properties from their fabrication conditions, and \u2018Model 2\u2019, which predicts the bone-formation rate from material properties and in vivo experimental conditions. By an inverse analysis of the two models, we proposed candidates for material fabrication conditions to achieve target values of bone-formation rate. Under the proposed conditions, the material properties of the fabricated material were consistent with the estimated material properties. Furthermore, a comparison between bone-formation rates after 12 weeks of implantation in the porcine tibia and the estimated bone-formation rate. This result showed that the actual bone-formation rates existed within the error range of the estimated bone-formation rates, indicating that machine learning consistently predicts the results of animal experiments using material fabrication conditions. We believe that these findings will lead to the establishment of alternative animal experiments to replace animal experiments in the development of artificial bones. },

 abstract = { ABSTRACT 
The fabrication, structure and electrical properties of new electrically conductive Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of polyaniline and polypyrrole have been investigated. Polyaniline in its emeraldine-base form was mixed with stearic acid (PAN-B\/SA) to produce stable films at the air-water interface (5\/1 or 10\/1 mole ratio of PAN-B\/SA). These films were then transferred into multilayer films which were found to exhibit conductivities of about 1 S\/cm upon doping with hydrochloric acid. The alkyl chains of the stearic acid molecules were found to be distributed randomly throughout the LB film thereby exerting a minimal influence on the electrical properties of the polyaniline phase. In addition to this mixed monolayer approach, a novel method of fabricating highly conductive polypyrrole LB films has been developed. This method is based on the sequential exposure of ferric st\u00e9arate LB films to hydrogen chloride (HC1) gas and pyrrole vapor. Each of these two solid state reactions was found to impart dramatic chemical and structural changes to the film. Polypyrrole LB films with conductivities as high as 5 S\/cm were produced via this process. The electrical and optical properties of films made by both techniques were examined in order to elucidate their structure\/property relationships. },

Despite the numerous studies dedicated to phthalocyanine molecules adsorbed on surfaces, in monolayer or thin film, very few works have been focused on the characterization of vapors of these molecules. In this article we present the C 1s, N 1s and Fe 2p photoemission results as well as N K\u2010edge X\u2010ray absorption data of iron phthalocyanine (FePc) in gas phase. Presented comparison of X\u2010ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X\u2010ray absorption spectroscopy spectra of FePc films show a great similarity with the gas phase results, confirming the molecular character of thick films. The Fe\u00a02p photoemission spectrum of the gas phase FePc, shown for the first time, can be considered as a fingerprint of the Fe(II) ionic state of the central metal of the iron phthalocyanine. The performed multiplet calculations for describing the Fe 2p XP spectrum indicate   (a e b ) state as the most probable ground state for thick film of iron phthalocyanine.\n   },

 abstract = { Abstract 
The manifold applications of porous materials, such as in storage, separation, and catalysis, have led to an enormous interest in their cost-efficient preparation. A promising strategy to obtain porous materials with adjustable pore size and morphology is to use templates exhibiting the appropriate nanostructure. In this study, close-packed polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles, synthesized by emulsion polymerization, were used to produce porous PS and ZnO inverse opals. The size and distribution of the polystyrene nanoparticles, characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), were controlled via the concentration of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Systematic measurements of the water\/styrene-interfacial tension show that the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the ternary water\u2013styrene\u2013SDS system, which determines whether monodisperse or polydisperse PS particles are obtained, is considerably lower than that of the binary water\u2013SDS system. The assemblies of close-packed PS nanoparticles obtained via drying were then studied by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and SEM. Both techniques prove that PS nanoparticles synthesized above the CMC result in a significantly unordered but denser packing of the particles. The polystyrene particles were subsequently used to produce porous polystyrene and ZnO inverse opals. While the former consists of micrometer-sized spherical pores surrounded by extended open-cellular regions of mesopores ( R  pore \u00a0\u2248\u200925\u00a0nm), the latter are made of ZnO-nanoparticles forming a structure of well-aligned interconnected pores. },

Octa(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrinate magnesium(II) has been treated with 96% sulfuric acid to obtain octa(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin. Coordination reactions of octa(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin and metal exchange of its magnesium complex with copper and nickel salts in dimethylformamide have been studied. Cu(II) and Ni(II) complexes with octa(2,6-difluorophenyl)tetraazaporphyrin have been synthesized. The resulting compounds have been identified by electron absorption, IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. The structures of the synthesized compounds were optimized by the DFT method. The fluorescence quantum yields of the studied compounds have been determined. },

Astrolabe observations made at Paris have been analysed to obtain more reliable values of the constants of nutation. A new method of reduction which takes account of variations in the zenith distance of the observations gave values for the 18.6 year and 9.3 year terms which are almost the same as those derived by classical methods, but for the annual and semi-annual terms the results are different. It is proposed to apply the new method to other series of observations. },

In this paper, we report our investigation on the monolayer characteristics of a nontoxic, biocompatible, and biodegradable polymer chitosan (CHS) using Langmuir\u2013Blodgett technique. It has been observed that pure CHS do not form stable monolayer. However, when CHS is mixed with arachidic acid (AA), stable self supporting monolayer is formed at air\u2013water interface. This also can be transferred onto solid substrate. CHS\u2013AA mixed monolayer is extremely stable with variation of pH. Atomic force microscopy study confirms the formation of stable uniform CHS\u2013AA films onto solid support. },

 Spin-coated thin films of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) were fabricated using different rotation speeds from 250 rpm to 1250 rpm. The structural characterization of these films was analyzed using UV-vis spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Gas sensing properties of these spun thin films were investigated against different volatile organic compounds such as chloroform, dichloromethane and toluene using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique. CuPc thin films were found to be highly sensitive to chloroform and dichloromethane vapor with fast response and recovery times. These measurements clearly indicated that the CuPc molecule is a promising material for the development of the room temperature vapor sensing applications with sensitivities between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] percent response ppm[Formula: see text]. Three different functional groups of CuPc structures coded as CuPc I, II and III were investigated which differ from each other in their chemical structures in terms of their microcycle ring groups and peripheral groups, all attached to the same free base porphyrin skeleton. The number of microcycle ring groups and peripheral groups were found to be efficient on the gas sensing properties. The calculated refractive index and extinction coefficients using SPR curves were [Formula: see text] for CuPc I thin film, [Formula: see text] for CuPc II thin film and [Formula: see text] for CuPc III thin film, respectively. For different substrate rotation speeds, the thin film thicknesses vary between 2[Formula: see text]nm and 6[Formula: see text]nm for CuPc I and CuPc III thin films whereas it ranges between 4[Formula: see text]nm and 9[Formula: see text]nm for CuPc II thin film.  },

 abstract = { Abstract 
Based on the theory of trade added value, this paper discusses the potential actual trade scale and benefit damage degree of the two countries under the background of big country game by measuring the real trade scale of China and the USA, simulating the economic impact of tariffs imposed by China and the USA and utilizing Wang\u2013Wei\u2013Zhu (WWZ) method to decompose the potential changes in Sino-US trade. The results show that: firstly, the size of China-US trade in terms of total value is significantly overestimated and China's overall trade with the USA in 2001\u20132014 was overestimated by an average of 3.06 percent, of which goods trade was overestimated by 8.06 percent. Secondly, although tariff increases can reduce the degree of trade imbalance between China and the USA to some extent, the adverse effects are mutual and global, and the European Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Japan and Canada become the main transfer countries of Sino-US trade. Thirdly, the pattern of China's final exports and the US' intermediate exports determines that China's trade interests are more damaged than those of the USA. It is proved that there is a big gap between China and the USA in the depth and breadth of China's participation in the value chain division of labor and the trade scale measured by Gross Domestic Product is more instructive than the total value.\n },

 abstract = {  Background 
Borderline personality disorder is a common type of personality disorder, and its patients have difficulties in emotional regulation and self-perception. As a high-risk financial activity, future investment may cause investors to produce huge financial and emotional pressure, resulting in negative emotional impact.    Subjects and Methods 
The study selected 100 investors who experienced futures explosion within a year as the experimental group, and 100 investors who did not experience futures explosion as the control group. The Borderline Personality Disorder Questionnaire was used to assess the borderline personality disorder traits of the investors and again to classify them into high and low borderline personality disorder trait groups. SPSS software was used for data analysis, and an independent sample t-test was used to compare the difference of ESI scores between different groups.    Results 
The results of the study showed that the mean borderline personality disorder trait score of the experimental group was 28.5\u00b15.7, while the mean ESI score of the control group was 24.2\u00b14.9. Independent sample t test showed that the score of BPD trait in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in the control group ( t  = 5.73,  P  < 0.001). The percentage of investors with borderline personality disorder trait scores higher than the standard scores reached 75% in the experimental group.    Conclusions 
The results show that the number of future bursts will significantly deepen the trait of borderline personality disorder and depression of investors.  },

The electronic nose (e-nose) is designed to crudely mimic the mammalian nose in that most contain sensors that non-selectively interact with odor molecules to produce some sort of signal that is then sent to a computer that uses multivariate statistics to determine patterns in the data. This pattern recognition is used to determine that one sample is similar or different from another based on headspace volatiles. There are different types of e-nose sensors including organic polymers, metal oxides, quartz crystal microbalance and even gas-chromatography (GC) or combined with mass spectroscopy (MS) can be used in a non-selective manner using chemical mass or patterns from a short GC column as an e-nose or \u201cZ\u201d nose. The electronic tongue reacts similarly to non-volatile compounds in a liquid. This review will concentrate on applications of e-nose and e-tongue technology for edible products and pharmaceutical uses. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
We propose a new concept for measuring the affinity between fields of academic research. The importance of interdisciplinary research has been increasingly emphasized in recent years. The degree of interdisciplinarity of a research article can be determined using bibliographic information from the cited literature. However, the properties of the affinity of each field to other fields have not yet been discussed. Therefore, we employ our method to quantify the affinity between 27 research fields using academic journal data from the citation and abstract database Scopus. We show that the affinity between fields should be viewed from two perspectives: the affinity of other fields to the field of interest, and the affinity of the field of interest to other fields. We identify the fields of \u201cArts and Humanities\u201d and \u201cSocial Sciences\u201d, and \u201cEarth and Planetary Sciences\u201d and \u201cEnvironmental Sciences\u201d, as those with the highest bidirectional affinity. We also demonstrate that affinity to \u201cMedicine\u201d is particularly high, with seven fields of interest having the highest affinity to this field: \u201cBiochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology\u201d, \u201cImmunology and Microbiology\u201d, \u201cNeuroscience\u201d, \u201cPharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics\u201d, \u201cNursing\u201d, \u201cDentistry\u201d, and \u201cHealth Professions\u201d. },

ET\u201018\u2010OCH 3  and ELL\u201012 (4\u22363\u22361\u22362, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine\/cholesterol\/dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine\u2010glutaric acid\/ET\u201018\u2010OCH 3 ), an optimal liposomal ET\u201018\u2010OCH 3  formulation, inhibited growth in the micromolar range in drug\u2010sensitive and\u2010resistant cells. In general, ET\u201018\u2010OCH 3 \u2010liposomes were about twofold less growth inhibitory than ET\u201018\u2010OCH 3 . However, the known hemolytic effects of ET\u201018\u2010OCH 3  were greatly reduced, up to 20 or more times, by liposome association. The effects of ET\u201018\u2010OCH 3  and ELL\u201012 were compared in intracellular [Ca 2+ ] modulation and DNA fragmentation assays. ET\u201018\u2010OCH 3  elicited both concentration\u2010 and serum\u2010dependent transient and permanent increases in intracellular [Ca 2+ ]. In contrast, ELL\u201012 did not modulate intracellular [Ca 2+ ]. ET\u201018\u2010OCH 3  and ELL\u201012 similarly affected DNA fragmentation, which may be indicative of apoptosis. The results suggest that, although the specific growth inhibitory effects of ET\u201018\u2010OCH 3  and ELL\u201012 are similar, associating ET\u201018\u2010OCH 3  with stable well\u2010characterized liposomes eliminates nonspecific cell membrane\u2010associated lytic effects. },

PPMG-based composite electrolytes were fabricated via the solution method using the polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone blend reinforced with various contents of sulfonated inorganic filler. Sulfuric acid was employed as the sulfonating agent to functionalize the external surface of the inorganic filler, i.e., graphene oxide. The proton conductivities of the newly prepared proton exchange membranes (PEMs) were increased by increasing the temperature and content of sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO), i.e., ranging from 0.025\u00a0S\/cm to 0.060\u00a0S\/cm. The induction of the optimum level of SGO is determined to be an excellent route to enhance ionic conductivity. The single-cell performance test was conducted by sandwiching the newly prepared PEMs between an anode (0.2\u00a0mg\/cm 2 \u00a0Pt\/Ru) and a cathode (0.2\u00a0mg\/cm 2 \u00a0Pt) to prepare membrane electrode assemblies, followed by hot pressing under a pressure of approximately 100\u00a0kg\/cm 2  at 60\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u201310\u00a0min. The highest power densities achieved with PPMG PEMs were 14.9 and 35.60\u00a0mW\/cm 2  at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 70\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, at ambient pressure with 100% relative humidity. Results showed that the newly prepared PEMs exhibit good electrochemical performance. The results indicated that the prepared composite membrane with 6 wt% filler can be used as an alternative membrane for applications of high-performance proton exchange membrane fuel cell. },

The complex composition of bacterial membranes has a significant impact on the understanding of pathogen function and their development towards antibiotic resistance. In addition to the inherent complexity and biosafety risks of studying biological pathogen membranes, the continual rise of antibiotic resistance and its significant economical and clinical consequences has motivated the development of numerous in vitro model membrane systems with tuneable compositions, geometries, and sizes. Approaches discussed in this review include liposomes, solid-supported bilayers, and computational simulations which have been used to explore various processes including drug-membrane interactions, lipid-protein interactions, host\u2013pathogen interactions, and structure-induced bacterial pathogenesis. The advantages, limitations, and applicable analytical tools of all architectures are summarised with a perspective for future research efforts in architectural improvement and elucidation of resistance development strategies and membrane-targeting antibiotic mechanisms.\n },

 abstract = { Abstract 
By airway surface liquid, we mean a thin fluid continuum consisting of the airway lining layer and the alveolar lining layer, which not only serves as a protective barrier against foreign particles but also contributes to maintaining normal respiratory mechanics. In recent years, measurements of the rheological properties of airway surface liquid have attracted considerable clinical attention due to new advances in microrheology instruments and methods. This article reviews the clinical relevance of measurements of airway surface liquid viscoelasticity and surface tension from four main aspects: maintaining the stability of the airways and alveoli, preventing ventilator-induced lung injury, optimizing surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory syndrome distress, and characterizing the barrier properties of airway mucus to improve drug and gene delivery. Primary measuring techniques and methods suitable for determining the viscoelasticity and surface tension of airway surface liquid are then introduced with respect to principles, advantages and limitations. Cone and plate viscometers and particle tracking microrheometers are the most commonly used instruments for measuring the bulk viscosity and microviscosity of airway surface liquid, respectively, and pendant drop methods are particularly suitable for the measurement of airway surface liquid surface tension in vitro. Currently, in vivo and in situ measurements of the viscoelasticity and surface tension of the airway surface liquid in humans still presents many challenges. },

The use of X-ray and neutron reflectivity has been generalized worldwide for scientists who want to determine specific physical properties (such as electron-density profile, scattering-length density, roughness and thickness) of films less than 200\u2005nm thick deposited on a substrate. This paper describes a freeware program named REFLEX , which is a standalone program dedicated to the simulation and analysis of X-ray and neutron reflectivity from multilayers. This program was first written two decades ago and has been constantly improved since, but never published until now. The latest version of REFLEX covers generalized types of calculation of reflectivity curves including both neutron and X-ray reflectivity. In the case of X-rays, the program can deal with both s and p polarization, which is quite important in the soft X-ray region where the two polarizations can yield different results. Neutron reflectivity is calculated within the framework of non-spin-polarized neutrons. REFLEX has also been designed to include any type of fluid (such as supercritical CO 2 ) on top of the analysed film and includes corrections of the footprint effect for analysis on an absolute scale. },

 Malignant primary brain tumors have a very high morbidity and mortality. Even though enormous advances have been made in primary brain tumor management, in the case of malignant primary brain tumors, current diagnostic strategies cannot identify exact infiltrating margins, surgery alone cannot achieve total mass resection, and adjuvant therapies cannot improve survivals. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore novel strategies to diagnose and treat such infiltrating brain tumors. Nanomaterials, particularly zero-dimensional and one-dimensional platforms, can carry various compounds such as contrast agents, anticancer drugs and genes into brain tumor cells specifically. Thus, contrast agent-based nanomaterials can selectively present infiltrating tumor outlines, while anticancer agent-based nanomaterials can specifically kill malignant tumor cells. In addition, dual-targeting nanomaterials, multifunctional nanocarriers, theranostic nanovehicles as well as convection-enhanced delivery technology hold promise to increase drug accumulation in tumor tissues, which could largely improve anticancer efficacy. In this review, we will mainly focus on the application of nanomaterials in preoperative diagnosis, intraoperative diagnosis and adjuvant treatment for malignant primary brain tumors.  },

The globalization of food distribution has made necessary to secure safe products to the general consumers through the rapid detection of harmful additives on the field. For this purpose, we developed a cuvette-type localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) sensor that can be easily used by consumers with conventional ultraviolet-visible light spectrophotometer for in-situ measurements. Gold nanoparticles were uniformly deposited on a transparent substrate via a self-assembly method to obtain a plasmonically active chip, and the chemical receptor p-nitroaniline (p-NA) was functionalized to stabilize the device sensitivity under external temperature and pH conditions. The fabricated chip was fixed onto a support and combined with a cuvette-type LSPR sensor. To evaluate the applicability of this sensor on the field, sensitivity and quantitative analysis experiments were conducted onto melamine as a model sample from harmful food additives. Under optimal reaction condition (2 mM p-NA for 20 min), we achieved an excellent detection limit (0.01 ppb) and a dynamic range allowing quantitative analysis over a wide concentration range (0.1\u20131000 ppb) from commercially available milk powder samples. },

Thin-film n-n nanoheterostructures of SnO2\/TiO2, highly sensitive to NO2, were obtained in a two-step process: (i) magnetron sputtering, MS followed by (ii) Langmuir-Blodgett, L\u2013B, technique. Thick (200 nm) SnO2 base layers were deposited by MS and subsequently overcoated with a thin and discontinuous TiO2 film by means of L\u2013B. Rutile nanopowder spread over the ethanol\/chloroform\/water formed a suspension, which was used as a source in L\u2013B method. The morphology, crystallographic and electronic properties of the prepared sensors were studied by scanning electron microscopy, SEM, X-ray diffraction, XRD in glancing incidence geometry, GID, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, XPS, and uv-vis-nir spectrophotometry, respectively. It was found that amorphous SnO2 films responded to relatively low concentrations of NO2 of about 200 ppb. A change of more than two orders of magnitude in the electrical resistivity upon exposure to NO2 was further enhanced in SnO2\/TiO2 n-n nanoheterostructures. The best sensor responses RNO2\/R0 were obtained at the lowest operating temperatures of about 120 \u00b0C, which is typical for nanomaterials. Response (recovery) times to 400 ppb NO2 were determined as a function of the operating temperature and indicated a significant decrease from 62 (42) s at 123 \u00b0C to 12 (19) s at 385 \u00b0C A much smaller sensitivity to H2 was observed, which might be advantageous for selective detection of nitrogen oxides. The influence of humidity on the NO2 response was demonstrated to be significantly below 150 \u00b0C and systematically decreased upon increase in the operating temperature up to 400 \u00b0C. },

Properties of the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of arachidic and stearic acids, versus the amount of the films\u2019 monolayers were studied and applied for chloroform vapor detection with acoustoelectric high-frequency SAW sensors, based on an AT quartz two-port Rayleigh type SAW resonator (414 MHz) and ST-X quartz SAW delay line (157.5 MHz). Using both devices, it was confirmed that the film with 17 monolayers of stearic acid deposited on the surface of the SAW delay line at a surface pressure of 30 mN\/m in the solid phase has the best sensitivity towards chloroform vapors, compared with the same films with other numbers of monolayers. For the SAW resonator sensing using slightly longer arachidic acid molecules, the optimum performance was reached with 17 LB film layers due to a sharper decrease in the Q-factor with mass loading. To understand the background of the result, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) in intermittent contact mode was used to study the morphology of the films, depending on the number of monolayers. The presence of the advanced morphology of the film surface with a maximal average roughness (9.3 nm) and surface area (29.7 \u00b5m2) was found only for 17-monolayer film. The effects of the chloroform vapors on the amplitude and the phase of the acoustic signal for both SAW devices at 20 \u00b0C were measured and compared with those for toluene and ethanol vapors; the largest responses were detected for chloroform vapor. For the film with an optimal number of monolayers, the largest amplitude response was measured for the resonator-based device. Conversely, the largest change in the acoustic phase produced by chloroform adsorption was measured for delay-line configuration. Finally, it was established that the gas responses for both devices coated with the LB films are completely restored 60 s after chamber cleaning with dry air. },

In this work, a sensitive coating based on Langmuir\u2013Blodgett (LB) films containing monolayers of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE) with an immobilized glucose oxidase (GOx) enzyme was created. The immobilization of the enzyme in the LB film occurred during the formation of the monolayer. The effect of the immobilization of GOx enzyme molecules on the surface properties of a Langmuir DPPE monolayer was investigated. The sensory properties of the resulting LB DPPE film with an immobilized GOx enzyme in a glucose solution of various concentrations were studied. It has shown that the immobilization of GOx enzyme molecules into the LB DPPE film leads to a rising LB film conductivity with an increasing glucose concentration. Such an effect made it possible to conclude that acoustic methods can be used to determine the concentration of glucose molecules in an aqueous solution. It was found that for an aqueous glucose solution in the concentration range from 0 to 0.8 mg\/mL the phase response of the acoustic mode at a frequency of 42.7 MHz has a linear form, and its maximum change is 55\u00b0. The maximum change in the insertion loss for this mode was 18 dB for a glucose concentration in the working solution of 0.4 mg\/mL. The range of glucose concentrations measured using this method, from 0 to 0.9 mg\/mL, corresponds to the corresponding range in the blood. The possibility of changing the conductivity range of a glucose solution depending on the concentration of the GOx enzyme in the LB film will make it possible to develop glucose sensors for higher concentrations. Such technological sensors would be in demand in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The developed technology can become the basis for creating a new generation of acoustoelectronic biosensors in the case of using other enzymatic reactions. },

Vietnam has an age-old history of education, and Vietnamese people have high respect for learning. However, early childhood education (ECE) in Vietnam has been the main concern only since 1945. This paper describes the process of establishment and development of ECE in Vietnam. Before and during the French colonial period in Vietnam, early childhood education was not considered a social task, and therefore, there was no formal educational system and curriculum for preschool children at this time. After 1945, with the great transformation of history, Vietnamese education has changed dramatically so that from 1945 to 1975 it was a period of political, social and educational separation. The historical events affect the education system and early childhood education in Vietnam. Consequently, the history of ECE in Vietnam is separated into two main phases, before and after 1975. Through the ups and downs of history, Vietnam has successfully built the ECE system. Over seven decades of development, ECE in Vietnam has made remarkable changes. The change comes not only from the expansion of the number of educational institutions, but also from the curriculum and pedagogy that are considered as the most important changes. Gradually escaping the influence of teacher-centered pedagogy, Vietnamese ECE is aiming to build a child-centered education, thereby helping learners to reach their full potential. },

Thermochromic coatings hold promise in reducing building energy consumption by dynamically regulating the heat gain of windows, which are often regarded as less energy-efficient components, across different seasons. Vanadium dioxide (VO 2 ) stands out as a versatile thermochromic material for smart windows owing to its reversible metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) alongside correlated structural and optical properties. In this review, we delve into recent advancements in the phase-change VO 2 -based thermochromic coatings for smart windows, spanning from the macroscopic crystal level to the microscopic structural level (including elemental doping and micro\/nano-engineering), as well as advances in controllable fabrication. It is notable that hybridizing functional elements\/materials (e.g., W, Mo\/SiO 2 , TiN) with VO 2  in delicate structural designs (e.g., core-shell, optical cavity) brings new degrees of freedom for controlling the thermochromic properties, including the MIT temperature, luminous transmittance, solar-energy modulation ability and building-relevant multi-functionality. Additionally, we provide an overview of alternative chromogenic materials that could potentially complement or surpass the intrinsic limitations of VO 2 . By examining the landscape of emerging materials, we aim to broaden the scope of possibilities for smart window technologies. We also offer insights into the current challenges and prospects of VO 2 -based thermochromic smart windows, presenting a roadmap for advancing this field towards enhanced energy efficiency and sustainable building design. In summary, this review innovatively categorizes doping strategies and corresponding effects of VO 2 , underscores their crucial NIR-energy modulation ability for smart windows, pioneers a theoretical analysis of inverse core-shell structures, prioritizes practical engineering strategies for solar modulation in VO 2  films, and summarizes complementary chromogenic materials, thus ultimately advancing VO 2 -based smart window technologies with a fresh perspective. },

Nanoarchitectonics describes the integration of nanotechnology with other fields as a postnanotechnology concept that elevates it to material science. Based on this fundamental principle, we address pore-engineered nanoarchitectonics with application targets for cancer therapy by combining basic descriptions and exemplifying therapy applications in this review. The initial two sections briefly summarize pore-engineered nanoarchitectonics basics according to classification based on (i) material porosity and (ii) material composition. Afterward, the main application-oriented section\u2014designing mesoporous material for cancer therapy\u2014is presented. Various types of drug delivery systems, including mesoporous nanoparticles as nanocarriers, endogenous stimuli-responsive drug delivery, exogenous stimuli-responsive drug delivery, and targeted drug delivery, are described. Importantly, the clinical translation of mesoporous materials is further discussed. Mesoporous materials are unique nanoparticles that offer a network of cavities as vehicles for drug nanocarriers. Regarding the developments that allow mesoporous nanoparticles to be broadly used in clinical settings, there are several challenges that should be solved for their clinical application. From a clinical perspective, there are tremendous processes in the development of mesoporous materials. },

Peptides with strong binding affinities for poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) resin were designed by use of materials informatics technology based on molecular dynamics simulation for the purpose of covering the resin surface with adhesive peptides, which were expected to result in eco-friendly and biocompatible biomaterials. From the results of binding affinity obtained with this molecular simulation, it was confirmed that experimental values could be predicted with errors <10%. By analyzing the simulation data with the response-surface method, we found that three peptides (RWWRPWW, EWWRPWR, and RWWRPWR), which consist of arginine (R), tryptophan (W), and proline (P), have strong binding affinity to the PMMA resin. These amino acids were effective because arginine and tryptophan have strong binding affinities for methoxycarbonyl groups and methyl groups, which are the main constituents of the PMMA resin, and proline stabilizes the flat zigzag structures of the peptides in water. The strong binding affinities of the three peptides were confirmed by experiments (surface plasmon resonance methods). },

Even though the mesoporous-type perovskite solar cell (PSC) is known for high efficiency, its planar-type counterpart exhibits lower efficiency and hysteretic response. Herein, we report success in suppressing hysteresis and record efficiency for planar-type devices using EDTA-complexed tin oxide (SnO 2 ) electron-transport layer. The Fermi level of EDTA-complexed SnO 2  is better matched with the conduction band of perovskite, leading to high open-circuit voltage. Its electron mobility is about three times larger than that of the SnO 2 . The record power conversion efficiency of planar-type PSCs with EDTA-complexed SnO 2  increases to 21.60% (certified at 21.52% by Newport) with negligible hysteresis. Meanwhile, the low-temperature processed EDTA-complexed SnO 2  enables 18.28% efficiency for a flexible device. Moreover, the unsealed PSCs with EDTA-complexed SnO 2  degrade only by 8% exposed in an ambient atmosphere after 2880\u2009h, and only by 14% after 120\u2009h under irradiation at 100\u2009mW\u2009cm \u22122 . },

Single-atom catalysts have recently been applied in many applications such as CO oxidation. Experimental in situ investigations into this reaction, however, are limited. Hereby, we present a suite of operando\/in situ spectroscopic experiments for structurally well-defined atomically dispersed Rh on phosphotungstic acid during CO oxidation. The identification of several key intermediates and the steady-state catalyst structure indicate that the reactions follow an unconventional Mars-van Krevelen mechanism and that the activation of O 2  is rate-limiting. In situ XPS confirms the contribution of the heteropoly acid support while in situ DRIFT spectroscopy consolidates the oxidation state and CO adsorption of Rh. As such, direct observation of three key components, i.e., metal center, support and substrate, is achieved, providing a clearer picture on CO oxidation on atomically dispersed Rh sites. The obtained information are used to engineer structurally similar catalysts that exhibit T 20  values up to 130\u2009\u00b0C below the previously reported Rh 1 \/NPTA. },

Optoelectronically active viscous liquids are ideal for fabricating foldable\/stretchable electronics owing to their excellent deformability and predictable \u03c0-unit\u2013based optoelectronic functions, which are independent of the device shape and geometry. Here we show, unprecedented \u2018liquid electret\u2019 devices that exhibit mechanoelectrical and electroacoustic functions, as well as stretchability, have been prepared using solvent-free liquid porphyrins. The fluidic nature of the free-base alkylated-tetraphenylporphyrins was controlled by attaching flexible and bulky branched alkyl chains at different positions. Furthermore, a subtle porphyrin ring distortion that originated from the bulkiness of alkyl chains was observed. Its consequences on the electronic perturbation of the porphyrin-unit were precisely elucidated by spectroscopic techniques and theoretical modelling. This molecular design allows shielding of the porphyrin unit by insulating alkyl chains, which facilitates its corona-charged state for a long period under ambient conditions. },

Single rich-stimuli-responsive organometallic polymers are considered to be the candidate for ultrahigh information storage and anti-counterfeiting security. However, their controllable synthesis has been an unsolved challenge. Here, we report the rapidly sequence-controlled electrosynthesis of organometallic polymers with exquisite insertion of multiple and distinct monomers. Electrosynthesis relies on the use of oxidative and reductive C\u2013C couplings with the\u00a0respective reaction time of 1\u2009min. Single-monomer-precision propagation does not need protecting and deprotecting steps used in solid-phase synthesis, while enabling the uniform synthesis and sequence-defined possibilities monitored by both UV\u2013vis spectra and cyclic voltammetry. Highly efficient electrosynthesis possessing potentially automated production can incorporate an amount of available metal and ligand species into a single organometallic polymer with complex architectures and functional versatility, which is proposed to have ultrahigh information storage and anti-counterfeiting security with low-cost coding and decoding processes at the single organometallic polymer level. },

Stem cells and their microenvironment interact cooperatively to\u00a0dictate their fates. Biomaterials are dynamically remodeled by stem cells, and stem cells sense and translate\u00a0the changes into cell fate decisions. We have previously reported that adaptive biomaterials composed of fibronectin inserted into protein nanosheets at a liquid interface enhance neuronal differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). However, we could not decouple clearly the effect of ligand density from that of fibrillary structure on cellular function and fate. Here we present an adaptive biomaterial based on two-dimensional networks of protein nanofibrils at a liquid\u2013liquid interface. Compared with flat protein nanosheets, this biomaterial enhances neuronal differentiation of hMSCs through a signaling mechanism involving focal adhesion kinase. Lipid raft microdomains in plasma membrane are found to play a central role in which hMSCs rapidly adapt to the dynamic microenvironment at the fluid interface. Our finding has substantial implications for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. },

Shrinking the size of the electronic synapse to molecular length-scale, for example, an artificial synapse directly fabricated by using individual or monolayer molecules, is important for maximizing the integration density, reducing the energy consumption, and enabling functionalities not easily achieved by other synaptic materials. Here, we show that the conductance of the self-assembled peptide molecule monolayer could be dynamically modulated by placing electrical biases, enabling us to implement basic synaptic functions. Both short-term plasticity (e.g., paired-pulse facilitation) and long-term plasticity (e.g., spike-timing-dependent plasticity) are demonstrated in a single molecular synapse. The dynamic current response is due to a combination of both chemical gating and coordination effects between Ag +  and hosting groups within peptides which adjusts the electron hopping rate through the molecular junction. In the end, based on the nonlinearity and short-term synaptic characteristics, the molecular synapses are utilized as reservoirs for waveform recognition with 100% accuracy at a small mask length. },

Delivering cancer therapeutics to tumors necessitates their escape from the surrounding blood vessels. Tumor vasculatures are not always sufficiently leaky. Herein, we engineer therapeutically competent leakage of therapeutics from tumor vasculature with gold nanoparticles capable of inducing endothelial leakiness (NanoEL). These NanoEL gold nanoparticles activated the loss of endothelial adherens junctions without any perceivable toxicity to the endothelial cells. Microscopically, through real time live animal intravital imaging, we show that NanoEL particles induced leakiness in the tumor vessels walls and improved infiltration into the interstitial space within the tumor. In both primary tumor and secondary micrometastases animal models, we show that pretreatment of tumor vasculature with NanoEL particles before therapeutics administration could completely regress the cancer. Engineering tumoral vasculature leakiness represents a new paradigm in our approach towards increasing tumoral accessibility of anti-cancer therapeutics instead of further increasing their anti-cancer lethality. },

Substituting carbon with silicon in organic molecules and materials has long been an attractive way to modify their electronic structure and properties. Silicon-doped graphene-based materials are known to exhibit exotic properties, yet conjugated organic materials with atomically precise Si substitution have remained difficult to prepare. Here we present the on-surface synthesis of one- and two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks whose backbones contain 1,4-disilabenzene (C 4 Si 2 ) linkers. Silicon atoms were first deposited on a Au(111) surface, forming a AuSi  x   film on annealing. The subsequent deposition and annealing of a bromo-substituted polyaromatic hydrocarbon precursor (triphenylene or pyrene) on this surface led to the formation of the C 4 Si 2 -bridged networks, which were characterized by a combination of high-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy supported by density functional theory calculations. Each Si in a hexagonal C 4 Si 2  ring was found to be covalently linked to one terminal Br atom. For the linear structure obtained with the pyrene-based precursor, the C 4 Si 2  rings were converted into C 4 Si pentagonal siloles by further annealing. },

Epigenomes enable the rectification of disordered cancer gene expression, thereby providing new targets for pharmacological interventions. The clinical utility of targeting histone H3 lysine trimethylation (H3K27me3) as an epigenetic hallmark has been demonstrated 1\u20137 . However, in actual therapeutic settings, the mechanism by which H3K27me3-targeting therapies exert their effects and the response of tumour cells remain unclear. Here we show the potency and mechanisms of action and resistance of the EZH1\u2013EZH2 dual inhibitor valemetostat in clinical trials of patients with adult T cell leukaemia\/lymphoma. Administration of valemetostat reduced tumour size and demonstrated durable clinical response in aggressive lymphomas with multiple genetic mutations. Integrative single-cell analyses showed that valemetostat abolishes the highly condensed chromatin structure formed by the plastic H3K27me3 and neutralizes multiple gene loci, including tumour suppressor genes. Nevertheless, subsequent long-term treatment encounters the emergence of resistant clones with reconstructed aggregate chromatin that closely resemble the pre-dose state. Acquired mutations at the PRC2\u2013compound interface result in the propagation of clones with increased H3K27me3 expression. In patients free of PRC2 mutations,  TET2  mutation or elevated  DNMT3A  expression causes similar chromatin recondensation through de novo DNA methylation in the H3K27me3-associated regions. We identified subpopulations with distinct metabolic and gene translation characteristics implicated in primary susceptibility until the acquisition of the heritable (epi)mutations. Targeting epigenetic drivers and chromatin homeostasis may provide opportunities for further sustained epigenetic cancer therapies. },

In this work, we report a facile way to fabricate composite nanofibrous mats of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and stearic acid (SA) by employing the electrospinning-technique, with PDMS fraction ranging from 40w% to nearly 80w%. The results show that for a predetermined fraction of PVA and SA, incorporation of an optimal amount of PDMS is necessary for which the mats exhibit the best mechanical behavior. Beyond this optimal PDMS fraction, the mechanical properties of the composite mats deteriorate. This result has been attributed to the ability of the SA molecules to mediate binding between the PVA and PDMS long-chain molecules  via  van-der-Waals bonding. The morphological, structural, mechanical, and thermal characterizations respectively using SEM, XRD, DMA\/tensile test, and DSC lend support to this explanation. By this method, it is possible to control the hydrophilicity\/oleophilicity of the mats, and the mats show an excellent selective permeability to oil as compared to water and successfully filter water from a water-in-oil emulsion. Incorporation of SA not only serves to aid in electrospinning of a PDMS-rich nanofibrous mat with good mechanical strength and control over hydrophilicity\/oleophilicity, but also has a potential use in fabricating sheets impregnated with phase change materials for thermal energy storage. },

Antimicrobial peptides are a promising class of new antibiotics with the ability to kill bacteria by disrupting their cell membrane, which is especially difficult for Gram-negative bacteria whose cell wall contains an outer layer of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Here we show that the cyclic decapeptide Labaditin (Lo), with proven activity against the Gram-positive  Staphylococcus aureus  and  Streptococcus mutans , is not able to kill the Gram-negative  Salmonella enterica  serovar Typhimurium ( S.e .s. Typhimurium). We found that Lo induced significant changes in the surface pressure isotherms of Langmuir monolayers representing the  Salmonella enterica  serovar Typhimurium inner membrane ( S.e .s. Typhimurium IM), and caused leakage in large unilamellar vesicles made with this IM lipid composition. On the basis of these results one should expect bactericidal activity against  S.e .s. Typhimurium. However, Lo could not interact with a monolayer of LPS, causing no significant changes in either the surface pressure isotherms or in the polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption spectra (PM-IRRAS). Therefore, the failure of Lo to kill  S.e .s. Typhimurium is associated with the lack of interaction with LPS from the outer bacteria membrane. Our approach with distinct monolayer compositions and combined techniques to investigate molecular-level interactions is useful for drug design to fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
Spin-coated self-assemblies of colloidal particles have been developed recently as an attractive close-packed monolayer of the particles for a variety of applications, but they are limited by the small area of their monolayers, especially given their low uniformity and monolayer coverage on large-area substrates. We report several noteworthy characteristics of a close-packed monolayer of polystyrene nanospheres (PS NSs) fabricated using a simple and inexpensive spin-coating method with a PS NS suspension mixed using the nonionic surfactant polyoxyethylene (12) tridecyl ether (PEO-TDE). In our study, we show that the PEO-TDE surfactant offers excellent wettability, surface tension, and a slow solvent evaporation rate of the PS NS suspension, similar to the conventional surfactant Triton X-100. We demonstrate that the relatively high monolayer coverage with reduced defects is produced when introducing the PEO-TDE surfactant. Specifically, monolayer coverage of more than 95% on a Si substrate was achieved, which is much better than that with the typical Triton X-100, and is one of the highest coverage rates realized by a spin-coating method. This excellent uniformity of the PS NS monolayer with high monolayer coverage is mainly attributed to the relatively low viscosity of the PS NS suspension, even at high concentrations of PEO-TDE. Moreover, the PEO-TDE surfactant provides highly uniform monolayers on a large-scale glass substrate even for large-sized PS NSs. We also highlight the fact that the PEO-TDE surfactant has another advantage in that the spin-coating process of the PS NS suspension can be done under common ambient laboratory conditions, unlike those required for the highly toxic Triton X-100. We therefore conclude that PEO-TDE can be a useful surfactant during the fabrication of close-packed monolayers for various applications owing to its simple and straightforward control of PS NSs, its uniform and high surface coverage, and due to the safety of the fabrication process. },

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are components of immune defense in many organisms, including plants. They combat pathogens due to their antiviral, antifungal and antibacterial properties, and are considered potential therapeutic agents. An example of AMP is Epsilon-Poly- l -lysine (EPL), a polypeptide formed by\u2009~\u200925 lysine residues with known antimicrobial activity against several human microbial pathogens. EPL presents some advantages such as good water solubility, thermal stability, biodegradability, and low toxicity, being a candidate for the control of phytopathogens. Our aim was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of EPL against four phytobacterial species spanning different classes within the Gram-negative phylum Proteobacteria:  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  (syn.  Rhizobium radiobacter ),  Ralstonia solanacearum ,  Xanthomonas citri  subsp.  citri  ( X. citri ), and  Xanthomonas euvesicatoria . The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the peptide ranged from 80\u00a0\u03bcg\/ml for  X. citri  to 600\u00a0\u03bcg\/ml for  R. solanacearum  and  X. euvesicatoria . Two hours of MIC exposure led to pathogen death due to cell lysis and was enough for pathogen clearance. The protective and curative effects of EPL were demonstrated on tomato plants inoculated with  X. euvesicatoria . Plants showed less disease severity when sprayed with EPL solution, making it a promising natural product for the control of plant diseases caused by diverse Proteobacteria. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
Since the discovery 25\u00a0years ago, many investigations have reported light-induced macroscopic mass migration of azobenzene-containing polymer films. Various mechanisms have been proposed to account for these motions. This study explores light-inert side chain liquid crystalline polymer (SCLCP) films with a photoresponsive polymer only at the free surface and reports the key effects of the topmost surface to generate surface relief gratings (SRGs) for SCLCP films. The top-coating with an azobenzene-containing SCLCP is achieved by the Langmuir\u2013Schaefer (LS) method or surface segregation. A negligible amount of the photoresponsive skin layer can induce large SRGs upon patterned UV light irradiation. Conversely, the motion of the SRG-forming azobenzene SCLCP is impeded by the existence of a LS monolayer of the octadecyl side chain polymer on the top. These results are well understood by considering the Marangoni flow driven by the surface tension instability. This approach should pave the way toward in-situ inscription of the surface topography for light-inert materials and eliminate the strong light absorption of azobenzene, which is a drawback in optical device applications. },

The molecular mechanism by which a mechanical stimulus is translated into a chemical response in biological systems is still unclear. We show that mechanical stretching of single cytoplasmic proteins can activate binding of other molecules. We used magnetic tweezers, total internal reflection fluorescence, and atomic force microscopy to investigate the effect of force on the interaction between talin, a protein that links liganded membrane integrins to the cytoskeleton, and vinculin, a focal adhesion protein that is activated by talin binding, leading to reorganization of the cytoskeleton. Application of physiologically relevant forces caused stretching of single talin rods that exposed cryptic binding sites for vinculin. Thus in the talin-vinculin system, molecular mechanotransduction can occur by protein binding after exposure of buried binding sites in the talin-vinculin system. Such protein stretching may be a more general mechanism for force transduction. },

\n            A fluid mosaic model is presented for the gross organization and structure of the proteins and lipids of biological membranes. The model is consistent with the restrictions imposed by thermodynamics. In this model, the proteins that are integral to the membrane are a heterogeneous set of globular molecules, each arranged in an\n             amphipathic \n            structure, that is, with the ionic and highly polar groups protruding from the membrane into the aqueous phase, and the nonpolar groups largely buried in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. These globular molecules are partially embedded in a matrix of phospholipid. The bulk of the phospholipid is organized as a discontinuous, fluid bilayer, although a small fraction of the lipid may interact specifically with the membrane proteins. The fluid mosaic structure is therefore formally analogous to a two-dimensional oriented solution of integral proteins (or lipoproteins) in the viscous phospholipid bilayer solvent. Recent experiments with a wide variety of techniques and several different membrane systems are described, all of which are consistent with, and add much detail to, the fluid mosaic model. It therefore seems appropriate to suggest possible mechanisms for various membrane functions and membrane-mediated phenomena in the light of the model. As examples, experimentally testable mechanisms are suggested for cell surface changes in malignant transformation, and for cooperative effects exhibited in the interactions of membranes with some specific ligands.\n           \n          
\n             Note added in proof \n            : Since this article was written, we have obtained electron microscopic evidence that the concanavalin A binding sites on the membranes of SV40 virus-transformed mouse fibroblasts (3T3 cells) are more clustered than the sites on the membranes of normal cells, as predicted by the hypothesis represented in Fig. 7B. There has also appeared a study by Taylor\n             et al. \n            showing the remarkable effects produced on lymphocytes by the addition of antibodies directed to their surface immunoglobulin molecules. The antibodies induce a redistribution and pinocytosis of these surface immunoglobulins, so that within about 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C the surface immunoglobulins are completely swept out of the membrane. These effects do not occur, however, if the bivalent antibodies are replaced by their univalent Fab fragments or if the antibody experiments are carried out at 0\u00b0C instead of 3\u00b0C. These and related results strongly indicate that the bivalent antibodies produce an aggregation of the surface immunoglobulin molecules in the plane of the membrane, which can occur only if the immunoglobulin molecules are free to diffuse in the membrane. This aggregation then appears to trigger off the pinocytosis of the membrane components by some unknown mechanism. Such membrane transformations may be of crucial importance in the induction of an antibody response to an antigen, as well as in other processes of cell differentiation.\n           },

Multilayer films of organic compounds on solid surfaces have been studied for more than 60 years because they allow fabrication of multicomposite molecular assemblies of tailored architecture.

An alternative approach\u2014fabrication of multilayers by consecutive adsorption of polyanions and polycations\u2014is far more general and has been extended to other materials such as proteins or colloids. Because polymers are typically flexible molecules, the resulting superlattice architectures are somewhat fuzzy structures, but the absence of crystallinity in these films is expected to be beneficial for many potential applications. },

Units of 2-ureido-4-pyrimidone that dimerize strongly in a self-complementary array of four cooperative hydrogen bonds were used as the associating end group in reversible self-assembling polymer systems. The unidirectional design of the binding sites prevents uncontrolled multidirectional association or gelation. Linear polymers and reversible networks were formed from monomers with two and three binding sites, respectively. The thermal and environmental control over lifetime and bond strength makes many properties, such as viscosity, chain length, and composition, tunable in a way not accessible to traditional polymers. Hence, polymer networks with thermodynamically controlled architectures can be formed, for use in, for example, coatings and hot melts, where a reversible, strongly temperature-dependent rheology is highly advantageous. },

The controlled transfer of organized monolayers of amphiphilic molecules from the air-water interface to a solid substrate was the first molecular-scale technology for the creation of new materials. However, the potential benefits of the technology envisioned by Langmuir and Blodgett in the 1930s have yet to be fully realized. Problems of reproducibility and defects and the lack of basic understanding of the packing of complex molecules in thin films have continued to thwart practical applications of Langmuir-Blodgett films and devices made from such films. However, modern high-resolution x-ray diffraction and scanning probe microscopy have proven to be ideal tools to resolve many of the basic questions involving thin organic films. Here, studies are presented of molecular order and organization in thin films of fatty acid salts, the prototypical system of Katharine Blodgett. Even these relatively simple systems present liquid, hexatic, and crystalline order; van der Waals and strained layer epitaxy on various substrates; wide variations in crystal symmetry and interfacial area with counterions; modulated superstructures; and coexisting lattice structures. The wide variety of possible structures presents both a challenge and an opportunity for future molecular design of organic thin-film devices. },

Detection of receptor-ligand interactions is generally accomplished by indirect assays such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A direct colorimetric detection method based on a polydiacetylene bilayer assembled on glass microscope slides has been developed. The bilayer is composed of a self-assembled monolayer of octadecylsilane and a Langmuir-Blodgett monolayer of polydiacetylene. The polydiacetylene layer is functionalized with an analog of sialic acid, the receptor-specific ligand for the influenza virus hemagglutinin. The sialic acid ligand serves as a molecular recognition element and the conjugated polymer backbone signals binding at the surface by a chromatic transition. The color transition is readily visible to the naked eye as a blue to red color change and can be quantified by visible absorption spectroscopy. Direct colorimetric detection by polydiacetylene films offers new possibilities for diagnostic applications and screening for new drug candidates or binding ligands. },

\n            The deposition of thin films from multiple materials is essential to a range of materials fabrication processes. Layer-by-layer processes involve the sequential deposition of two or more materials that physically bond together. Richardson\n             et al. \n            review some of the techniques and materials that are used to make thin films, including sequential dip coating, spraying, and electrochemical deposition. Despite the versatility of the methods and the range of materials that can be deposited, the techniques remain mostly confined to the lab because of challenges in industrial scaling. But because there is tremendous scope for fine-tuning the structure and properties of the multilayers, there is interest in broadening the use of these techniques.\n           \n

\n            Hydrogels are typically weak materials because they contain only a small fraction of polymeric material highly swollen with water.

Developing the aggregation indcued emission (AIE) nanodots as alternates to the conventional inorganic quantum dots is a contemporary research interest towards assorted applications. Herein, we have designed and synthesized a tripodal structured pyrene Schiff base (PS) and it is characterized by  1 H\u2009NMR,  13 C\u2009NMR and ESI\u2010MS techniques. The developed PS exhibit an excellent AIE property in THF:water (10:90) ratio. The formed PS aggregates were meticulously characterized by HR\u2010SEM, HR\u2010TEM and AFM measurements. The results reveal that the PS aggregates are spherical in shape with an average diameter of \u223c 1\u2005nm. Hence, the PS aggregates are expressed as AIE nanodots. Intriguingly, the AIE nanodots has high fluorescence lifetime (4 ns) and quantum yield of 54\u2009%, which are adequate to compete with the commercial fluorophores. In addition, molecular structure dependent nano shapes have also been investigated. The PS based AIE nanodots were successfully utilized as a fluorescent probe for several applications such as in\u2010vitro bioimaging, detection of picric acid and photoinduced electron transfer studies. The confocal fluorescence images of nanodots in HeLa and HEK live cells exhibit higher fluorescence signal which clearly reveal that AIE nanodots can be used as a promising probe for in\u2010vitro bio\u2010imaging application. Moreover, the AIE nanodots are employed to detect the picric acid through fluorescence quenching method. Towards the commercial application, the low\u2010cost fluorescent test strips have also been developed for the detection of picric acid. We have also investigated the electron transfer nature of AIE nanodots with benzyl viologen towards the energy related applications. },

Green hydrogen synthesis has attracted researchers due to energy resource applications. Non\u2010renewable energy sources have been found to be incapable of meeting energy demands. Therefore, the need of the hour is to introduce an alternative to produce an efficient amount of H 2 . This review has summarized and investigated hetero\u2010catalysts and their hydrogen production potential under different light illuminations. Here, the syntheses of various nanoparticles (NPs) and composite semiconductors have been reviewed, and insights into the enhanced ability of noble\u2010free metal electrocatalysts have been provided. Specific nanomaterials, such as nickel, ruthenium, silver, boron\u2010doped SnO 2 , AgVO 3 , cobalt\u2010ferrite, and cobalt, dominate in synthesizing durable electrocatalysts. These exhibit Schottky junctions and enhance catalytic behaviour for hydrogen production. Finally, the challenges of the nanoparticle\u2018s structural and conductive properties and critical solutions are discussed. This review discusses mechanistic insights, interactions, and kinetics that involve a higher H 2  synthesis rate. },

A magnetorheological fluid (MRF) mount featuring unidirectional squeeze mode for vehicle engine mounting system is proposed and designed to attenuate the engine vibration with characteristics of broadband and small amplitude. The MRF mount is comprised of upper and lower bases for installation, a main rubber for static load, a bobbin for electromagnetic coil winding and a squeeze plate. The bottom surface of the bobbin and the top surface of the squeeze plate form the polar plates, between which the MRF is squeezed during the rebound of the MRF mount. Combining dynamic stiffness property of passive hydraulic mounts without fluid and adjustable damping force of MRF at squeeze mode, the MRF mount could provide a unique variable dynamic stiffness and damping properties, by adjusting the exciting current. To evaluate the performance of the MRF mount, a mathematical model considering the behavior of MRF at squeeze mode is derived to theoretically analyze and numerically simulate the dynamic stiffness and equivalent damping properties of the MRF mount. Further, the MRF mount based quarter vehicle mounting system model considering suspension system is constructed to analyze the force transmissibility of engine mounting system in frequency domain and simulate the relative displacement response in time domain. },

Self\u2010assembly continuously gains attention as an excellent method to create novel nanoscale structures with a wide range of applications in photonics, optoelectronics, biomedical engineering, and heat transfer applications. However, self\u2010assembly is governed by a diversity of complex interparticle forces that cause fabricating defectless large scale (>1 cm) colloidal crystals, or opals, to be a daunting challenge. Despite numerous efforts to find an optimal method that offers the perfect colloidal crystal by minimizing defects, it has been difficult to provide physical interpretations that govern the development of defects such as grain boundaries. This study reports the control over grain domains and intentional defect characteristics that develop during evaporative vertical deposition. The degree of particle crystallinity and evaporation conditions is shown to govern the grain domain characteristics, such as shapes and sizes. In particular, the grains fabricated with 300 and 600 nm sphere diameters can be tuned into single\u2010column structures exceeding \u22481 mm by elevating heating temperature up to 93 \u00b0C. The understanding of self\u2010assembly physics presented in this work will enable the fabrication of novel self\u2010assembled structures with high periodicity and offer fundamental groundworks for developing large\u2010scale crack\u2010free structures. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
Mechanical cues of cellular microenvironments can modulate cell functions including cell spreading and differentiation. Most studies of cellular functions are performed using a solid substrate, and it is thought that cells cannot spread on fluid substrates because of rapid relaxation, which cannot resist against actomyosin\u2010based cell contractility. Here, the spreading and growth of anchorage\u2010dependent cells such as human mesenchymal stem cells at the liquid interface between a perfluorocarbon fluid and the culture medium are observed. It is demonstrated that a monomolecular protein nanosheet self\u2010assembled at a fluid interface is sufficiently rigid to support cell spreading without additional treatment. Fine tuning of the packing of these proteins at the liquid interface permits tailoring of the mechanics of the protein layer, ultimately allowing for the regulation of cell spreading. The greater stiffness of the protein nanosheets triggers cell spreading, adhesion growth, and yes\u2010associated protein nuclear translocation. Cell behavior at the fluid interface is explained within the framework of the molecular clutch model. In addition, the freestanding ultrathin protein nanosheets are extremely flexible, easily deformed, and perceived by cells as being much softer. The findings are expected to provide a new perspective for insights into cell\u2013material interactions. },

In situ monitoring the evolution of electrode materials in micro\/nano scale is crucial to understand the intrinsic mechanism of rechargeable batteries.

With an interdigital device configuration, a splendid Ohmic contact between MnO 2  LBNWs and pyrolytic carbon current collector is demonstrated here, enabling a small polarization voltage. In addition, this work reveals, for the first time, that the conductance of MnO 2  LBNWs monotonically increases\/decreases when the ZIBs are charged\/discharged. Multistep phase transition is mainly responsible for the mechanism of the ZIBs, as evidenced by combined high\u2010resolution transmission electron microscopy and in situ Raman spectroscopy. This work provides a new and adaptable platform for microchip\u2010based in situ simultaneous electrochemical and physical detection of batteries, which would promote the fundamental and practical research of nanowire electrode materials in energy storage applications. },

 abstract = { Abstract 
Black phosphorus (BP) is recently becoming more and more popular among semiconducting 2D materials for (opto)electronic applications. The controlled physisorption of molecules on the BP surface is a viable approach to modulate its optical and electronic properties. Solvents consisting of small molecules are often used for washing 2D materials or as liquid media for their chemical functionalization with larger molecules, disregarding their ability to change the opto\u2010electronic properties of BP. Herein, it is shown that the opto\u2010electronic properties of mechanically exfoliated few\u2010layer BP are altered when physically interacting with common solvents. Significantly, charge transport analysis in field\u2010effect transistors reveals that physisorbed solvent molecules induce a modulation of the charge carrier density which can be as high as 10 12  cm \u22122  in BP, i.e., comparable to common dopants such as F 4 \u2010TCNQ and MoO 3 . By combining experimental evidences with density functional theory calculations, it is confirmed that BP doping by solvent molecules not only depends on charge transfer, but is also influenced by molecular dipole. The results clearly demonstrate how an exquisite tuning of the opto\u2010electronic properties of few\u2010layer BP can be achieved through physisorption of small solvent molecules. Such findings are of interest both for fundamental studies and more technological applications in opto\u2010electronics. },

EVs possess the capacity to evade the immune system and remain stable over long periods, identifying them as natural carriers for drugs and biologics. However, the challenges associated with EVs isolation, heterogeneity, coexistence with homologous biomolecules, and lack of site\u2010specific delivery, have impeded their potential. In recent years, the amalgamation of EVs with rationally engineered nanostructures has been proposed for achieving effective drug loading and site\u2010specific delivery. With the advancement of nanotechnology and nanoarchitectonics, different nanostructures with tunable size, shapes, and surface properties can be integrated with EVs for drug loading, target binding, efficient delivery, and therapeutics. Such integration may enable improved cellular targeting and the protection of encapsulated drugs for enhanced and specific delivery to target cells. This review summarizes the recent development of nanostructure amalgamated EVs for drug delivery, therapeutics, and real\u2010time monitoring of disease progression. With a specific focus on the exosomal cargo, diverse drug delivery system, and biomimetic nanostructures based on EVs for selective drug delivery, this review also chronicles the needs and challenges of EV\u2010based biomimetic nanostructures and provides a future outlook on the strategies posed. },

Carbon\u2010based quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a fascinating class of advanced materials with a unique combination of optoelectronic, biocompatible, and catalytic characteristics, apt for a plethora of applications ranging from electronic to photoelectrochemical devices. Recent research works have established carbon\u2010based QDs for those frontline applications through improvements in materials design, processing, and device stability. This review broadly presents the recent progress in the synthesis of carbon\u2010based QDs, including carbon QDs, graphene QDs, graphitic carbon nitride QDs and their heterostructures, as well as their salient applications. The synthesis methods of carbon\u2010based QDs are first introduced, followed by an extensive discussion of the dependence of the device performance on the intrinsic properties and nanostructures of carbon\u2010based QDs, aiming to present the general strategies for device designing with optimal performance. Furthermore, diverse applications of carbon\u2010based QDs are presented, with an emphasis on the relationship between band alignment, charge transfer, and performance improvement. Among the applications discussed in this review, much focus is given to photo and electrocatalytic, energy storage and conversion, and bioapplications, which pose a grand challenge for rational materials and device designs. Finally, a summary is presented, and existing challenges and future directions are elaborated. },

This study demonstrates the developments of self\u2010assembled optical metasurfaces to overcome inherent limitations in polarization density ( P ) and high refractive indices ( n ) within naturally occurring materials. The Maxwellian macroscopic description establishes a link between  P  and  n , revealing a static limit in natural materials, restricting  n  to \u22484.0 at optical frequencies. Previously, it is accepted that self\u2010assembly enables the creation of nanogaps between metallic nanoparticles (NPs), boosting capacitive enhancement of  P  and resultant exceptionally high  n  at optical frequencies. The work focuses on assembling gold (Au) NPs into a closely packed monolayer by rationally designing the polymeric ligand to balance attractive and repulsive forces, in that polymeric brush\u2010mediated self\u2010assembly of the close\u2010packed Au NP monolayer is robustly achieved over a large\u2010area. The resulting monolayer of Au nanospheres (NSs), nanooctahedras (NOs), and nanocubes (NCs) exhibits high macroscopic integrity and crystallinity, sufficiently enough for pushing  n  to record\u2010high regimes. The systematic comparisons between each differently shaped Au NP monolayers elucidate the significance of capacitive coupling in achieving an unnaturally high  n . The achieved  n  of 10.12 at optical frequencies stands as a benchmark, highlighting the potential of polyhedral Au NPs in advancing optical metasurfaces. },

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major cause of death worldwide. This urges the search for alternatives to antibiotics, and antimicrobial polymers hold promise due to their reduced susceptibility to AMR. The topology of such macromolecules has a strong impact on their activity, with bottlebrush architectures outperforming their linear counterparts significantly. Consequently, understanding the specific behavior of macromolecules featuring a confined conformation of linear subunits is pertinent. This study focusses on revealing fundamental differences between architectures regarding properties as well as interaction with biological membranes. Various analytical techniques (using membrane mimics and spectroscopic methods) are used to generate insights revealing the following trends: A) The reduction of degrees of freedom in bottle brushes reduces their tendencies for self\u2010assembly and undesired protein interaction. B) When compared to linear polymers, bottlebrushes attach to membranes faster and more efficiently as well as in a unimolecular fashion. Their multivalent presentation of linear subunits also leads to aggregation between liposomes, which is not induced by linear polymers. C) Neutron reflectometry measurements show an increased tendency of bottle brushes to insert into the hydrophobic tails of phospholipid monolayers. The knowledge about these features will fuel the future development of even more efficient antimicrobial polymers. },

Along with the progresses of material syntheses, the importance of structural regulation is realized to rationally improve the efficiencies and specificities in target functions. Small science is necessary for advanced material systems. A novel concept, nanoarchitectonics, to combine nanotechnology with the other scientific disciplines to synthesize a functional material system with contributions of small objects, nano\u2010units, is recently proposed. Based on facts and knowledge in nanoscale objects explored by nanotechnology, functional material systems are constructed using nano\u2010units with the aid of the other research fields, such as organic chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, materials science, and biology. The introduction of nanoarchitectonics essences to material construction can produce unusual functional systems, such as brain\u2010like information processing based on atomic\u2010level reactions, diffusions, and aggregations. Probe\u2010tip\u2010mediated organic reactions are also possible with precise site selectivity. The coupling of equilibrium self\u2010assemblies and non\u2010equilibrium fabrication processes results in variously structured and hierarchical functional structures even from simple 0D nano\u2010units such as fullerenes. Especially, interfacial nanoarchitectonics directly bridge nanoscopic functions and macroscopic actions, including facile contact with nanostructures and living cells. This review article overviews nanoarchitectonics from origin to future, from atoms to materials, and from small science to big technology.  },

Next\u2010generation healthcare equipment and devices are in great demand for point\u2010of\u2010care testing (POCT), in view of their applications in rapid disease diagnosis, personalized medicine, portable or mobile health care, nontechnician assays, etc. Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) biosensors, which are based on noble\u2010metal nanostructures and which provide fast, real\u2010time, nonlabeled, and sensitive biochemical detections, have become one of the leading candidates for POCT. The advances in nanofabrication, molecular biotechnology, and optoelectronics integration technology have promoted LSPR biosensing to low\u2010cost, easy\u2010to\u2010use, and on\u2010site POCT. Here, a synopsis of LSPR nano\u2010biosensors and LSPR\u2010based POCT devices is provided by delineating the fundamental principles of LSPR sensing, various metal nanostructures, the modification layers on LSPR nanostructures, and the integration of LSPR biosensors into devices. Examples of applications of existing LSPR\u2010based microfluidic platforms and POCT devices in healthcare, public security, environmental monitoring, and food safety, for example, are given. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of developing LSPR\u2010based POCT techniques are highlighted.

Among all kinds of functional systems and mechanisms, living cells may be regarded as the most advanced functional material systems. Creation of cell\u2010like highly functional systems can be an ultimate goal of nanoarchitectonics research. Although full construction of cell\u2010like functional objects may not be going to happen anytime soon, controls of living cells by small molecules and their nanoarchitected assemblies can be accomplishable research subjects. Nanoarchitectonics approaches are helpful for small molecules and nanostructures to regulate living cells. In this review article, several examples in cell regulation with bio\u2010related molecules and cell regulation with the aid of external stimuli such as electronic and photonic stimuli are first exhibited. Following these examples, controls of cell alignments and differentiations at extremely different interfacial media, the surface with hard nanocarbon structures, and completely soft liquid\u2013liquid interface, are discussed. Especially, interaction at contacting external surface can trigger integrated relayed processes within living cells which may finally alter cellular behaviors and eventually guide stem cell differentiation. Surface designing by interfacial nanoarchitectonics can be a crucial key in regulation of living cells. It can lead to technology connection between surface nanofabrication and tissue engineering and cell\u2010based technology. },

Mechanical stimuli have rather ambiguous and less\u2010specific features among various physical stimuli, but most materials exhibit a certain level of responses upon mechanical inputs. Unexplored sciences remain in mechanical responding systems as one of the frontiers of materials science. Nanoarchitectonics approaches for mechanically responding materials are discussed as mechano\u2010nanoarchitectonics in this review article. Recent approaches on molecular and materials systems with mechanical response capabilities are first exemplified with two viewpoints: i) mechanical control of supramolecular assemblies and materials and ii) mechanical control and evaluation of atom\/molecular level structures. In the following sections, special attentions on interfacial environments for mechano\u2010nanoarchitectonics are emphasized. The section entitled iii) Mechanical Control of Molecular System at Dynamic Interface describes coupling of macroscopic mechanical forces and molecular\u2010level phenomena. Delicate mechanical forces can be applied to functional molecules embedded at the air\u2013water interface where operation of molecular machines and tuning of molecular receptors upon macroscopic mechanical actions are discussed. Finally, the important role of the interfacial media are further extended to the control of living cells as described in the section entitled iv) Mechanical Control of Biosystems. Pioneering approaches on cell fate regulations at liquid\u2013liquid interfaces are discussed in addition to well\u2010known mechanobiology. },

Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has been researched for various applications by control of characteristics such as chirality and magnitude. Supramolecular chirality has been prepared by vortex motion as a mechanical stimulus; however, CPL has yet to be controlled precisely and reproducibly. In this work, the first precise control of CPL under vortex flow conditions at an air\u2010water interface is reported. The supramolecular chirality of aggregates consisting of an achiral trans\u2010bis(salicylaldiminato)Pt(II) complex bearing hexadecyl chains is induced and controlled with vortex flow at the air\u2010water interface, whereas the complex naturally forms an achiral amorphous solid with non\u2010chiroptical properties under non\u2010vortex conditions. The CPL direction and magnitude ( g  lum  value) of the Pt(II) complex aggregates can be adjusted precisely according to the vortex conditions, including the rotatory direction and flow rate. Vortex\u2010flow\u2010induced emission enhancement is also observed upon an increase in the rate of the vortex flow. },

The development of photosensitive materials for erasable photopatterning is of significant interest in anti\u2010counterfeiting and information storage applications. Herein two kinds of stilbene\u2010based metal\u2010organic framework (MOF) films with layer by layer method for studying photopatterning is reported. The resulting 2D Zn 2 (sdc) 2  MOF film (sdc = 4,4\u2032\u2010stilbenedicarboxylate) exhibits excellent photosensitive features with a very short photoconversion time (<35\u00a0s) while the 3D MOF Zn 4 O(sdc) 6  film does not have the property due to the fact that only parallel and short distance arrangement of olefin groups in the adjacent MOF layers can trigger [2+2] photocycloaddition. Furthermore, the Zn 2 (sdc) 2  film indicates obvious reversible fluorescent photoswitch behavior between yellow and blue fluorescence emission, which can achieve high\u2010efficient, erasable photopatterning with various sizes (ca. 20 microns to decimeter). This study not only develops a new kind of photosensitive crystalline network film but also provides erasable photopatterning from macroscopic to microscopic in optical applications. },

Nanosphere lithography, an inexpensive and high throughput technique capable of producing nanostructure (below 100\u2009nm feature size) arrays, relies on the formation of a monolayer of self-assembled nanospheres, followed by custom-etching to produce nanometre size features on large-area substrates. A theoretical model underpinning the self-ordering process by centrifugation is proposed to describe the interplay between the spin speed and solution concentration. The model describes the deposition of a dense and uniform monolayer by the implicit contribution of gravity, centrifugal force and surface tension, which can be accounted for using only the spin speed and the solid\/liquid volume ratio. We demonstrate that the spin recipe for the monolayer formation can be represented as a pathway on a 2D phase plane. The model accounts for the ratio of polystyrene nanospheres (300\u2009nm), water, methanol and surfactant in the solution, crucial for large area uniform and periodic monolayer deposition. The monolayer is exploited to create arrays of nanoscale features using \u2018short\u2019 or \u2018extended\u2019 reactive ion etching to produce 30\u201360\u2009nm (diameter) nanodots or 100\u2013200\u2009nm (diameter) nanoholes over the entire substrate, respectively. The nanostructures were subsequently utilized to create master stamps for nanoimprint lithography. },

The current paper aims to analyze the keywords related to mobile banking (otherwise known as m-banking) issues by focusing on its development from 2000 to 2020, of which the first publication about this issue appeared in the Scopus database. This paper explored and analyzed 1206 research papers using the Scopus database. Bibliometric analysis and content analysis had been conducted through Excel and VOS viewer software to obtain the results. In addition, the findings of this paper reveal that the universal trends and increased production at a global level led to many changes, and the most rampant topic associated with m-banking in most periods is mobile telecommunication systems. By showcasing the creation of the key terms in m-banking, it was possible to identify significant changes in the development of the field\u2019s key terminologies. Therefore, it is important to follow up on the development in future decades, particularly how the recent universal occurrences have influenced the changes in m-banking use at a global level. Moreover, the present study makes a significant contribution to the literature by providing a framework for future research. The framework provides opportunities for researchers to explore the research streams in future research. Finally, the current paper is the first of its kind in its method of contribution, ad according to the research databases (Scopus, Google Scholar, etc.), no work was witnessed in the published literature covering m-banking in a detailed and comprehensive multi-period manner and in such an applied method. In addition, the current paper fills this gap by conducting a bibliometric analysis and content analysis. },

Legionella dumoffii is an intracellular pathogen of freshwater protozoans capable of infecting and multiplying in mammalian cells, causing a severe respiratory disease called Legionnaires\u2019 disease. The pathomechanism of infection development is very complex and depends on many factors, including the structure and properties of macromolecules that build the components of the L.\u00a0dumoffii cell envelope. Phospholipids (PLs) forming biological membranes have a significant impact on the integrity of the membrane as well as on the interactions with the host cells. L.\u00a0dumoffii changes its lipid profile under the influence of external factors, which allows it to adapt to the living environment. One of the factors altering the PL composition is the presence of exogenous choline. The aim of this study was to determine the physicochemical properties of the model bacterial membranes adsorbed at the air\u2013liquid interface (Langmuir monolayers). They were composed of phospholipids isolated from L. dumoffii cultured with (PL+choline) and without (PL\u2212choline) choline. Moreover, the effect of the human cathelicidin (LL-37 peptide) added to the subphase on these monolayers was analyzed in terms of phospholipid\u2013peptide interactions. The results indicated that the monolayers of PL+choline were slightly more condensed than PL\u2212choline. In the presence of LL-37, the elasticity of both monolayers increased; thus, their molecular packing and ordering decreased. The disturbing effect was related to the peptide\u2019s antibacterial activity. },

Supramolecular systems based on transition metal complexes capable of reversible redox isomerization due to intramolecular electron transfer are one of the most interesting objects from the viewpoint of molecular switches\u2019 design. In the present work, a comparative analysis of valence transformation of lanthanide complexes (Sm, Er, Tm and Yb) with donor-substituted bis-phthalocyaninates occurring during the formation and compression\u2013extension of Langmuir monolayers was carried out using data of UV\u2013Vis\u2013NIR spectroscopy. It is shown that the numerical values of the Q-band positions in the absorption spectra for the extended monolayers of the complexes under study depend linearly on the ionic radius of the metal center, if the metals have an oxidation state of +2. This makes it possible to draw a direct analogy between the behavior of the studied compounds and analogous europium and cerium complexes, for which direct evidence of the valence tautomerism in such planar systems was obtained earlier. This led to the conclusion that the intramolecular electron transfer from the phthalocyanine ligand to the central metal ion [Ln3+(R4Pc2\u2212)(R4Pc\u2022\u2212)]0\u2192[Ln2+(R4Pc\u2022\u2212)2]0 occurs when solutions of donor-substituted bis-phthalocyaninates of samarium, erbium, thulium, and ytterbium are deposited onto the water subphase, and the reverse redox-isomeric transition is observed in most cases when the monolayer is compressed to high surface pressures. The first of these switches is related to the asymmetry of the air\/water interface, and the second one is controlled by the lateral compression\u2013expansion of the monolayer. It has been demonstrated that when bis-phthalocyanine monolayers of lanthanides with variable valence are transferred to solid substrates, the valence state of the metal center, and consequently, the redox-isomeric state of the complex, do not change. This means that we are able to form films with a predetermined state of the complex. Note that the redox-isomeric state of complexes should affect the entire range of physicochemical properties of such films. },

Scientists are often inspired by nature, where naturally occurring morphologies, such as those that resemble animals and plants, can be created in the lab. In this review, we have provided an overview on complex superstructures of animals, plants and some similar shapes from the natural world. We begin this review with a discussion about the formation of various animal\u2010like shapes from small organic molecules and polymers, and then move onto plants and other selected shapes. Literature surveys reveal that most of the polymers studied tend to form micellar structures, with some exceptions. Nevertheless, small organic molecules tend to form not only micellar structures but also other animal shapes such as worms and caterpillars. These superstructures tend to have high surface areas and variable surface morphology, making them very useful material for applications in various field such as catalysis, solar cells, and biomedicine, amongst others. },

Formose reaction facilitates the synthesis of sugars from formaldehyde, yet the valuable sugars constitute only a small portion of the total products. This necessitates the need for a chemical scavenger capable of selectively capturing only valuable sugars. With over 600,000 potential combinations of boronic acid-based scavengers available, pursuing a deductive search approach is unfeasible. This study aims to derive guidelines for designing scavengers that readily bind with target sugars while avoiding nontarget ones via machine learning informed by density functional theory calculations. },

 In this work, surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopy and normal vibrational spectroscopy as well as density functional theory (DFT) computational methods have been employed to investigate the nature of the chemical adsorption and orientation of the surface species generated from salicylic acid at silver surfaces. The structure of salicylic acid and its IR and Raman spectra are determined at the B3LYP\/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory. These results are used in the assignment of the vibrational spectra. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra obtained from silver island films thinly coated with salicylic acid confirm chemical adsorption on the Ag nanostructures. To probe the nature of this surface complex, the optimized geometries and IR and Raman spectra of two model salicylate-silver complexes (Ag1 and Ag2) were calculated at the B3LYP\/Lanl2DZ level of theory. It was found that good agreement exists between experimentally observed SERS spectra and the simulated SERS spectra of a complex with the salicylate monoanion bound to a Ag +  ion through its carboxylate group (Ag1). The carboxylate silver salt of salicylic acid (essentially the Ag1 complex) was also prepared, and its IR and Raman spectra were recorded for comparison with the surface-enhanced vibrational spectra. These results, along with the application of surface selection rules, suggest that salicylic acid is deprotonated at silver surfaces, interacting through its carboxylate group alone, and is preferentially in a tilted head-on orientation.Key words: chemisorption, salicylic acid, silver, density functional theory, surface-enhanced Raman scattering, reflection-absorption IR spectroscopy, surface-enhanced IR absorption.  },

The development of multifunctional and robust swimming microrobots working at the free air-liquid interface has encountered challenge as new manipulation strategy are needed to overcome the complicated interfacial restrictions. Here, we show flexible but reliable mechanisms to achieve a remote-control bubble microrobot with multiple working modes and high maneuverability by the assistance of a soft air-liquid interface. This bubble microrobot is developed from a hollow Janus microsphere regulated by a magnetic field, which can implement switchable working modes like pusher, gripper, anchor and sweeper. The cavitation of the microbubble and the accompanying directional jet flow play a key role for functioning in these working modes, which is analogues to \"bubble tentacle\". In particular, we find a novel speed modulation method for the bubble microrobot that does not need to change the fuel concentration. Our findings demonstrate a substantial advance of the bubble microrobot specifically working at the air-liquid interface. And the results depict the nonintuitive mechanisms, such as bubble dynamics confined by a free surface, hydrodynamic jetting and surface capillary wave induced by bubble collapse, and bubble particle interaction, which offer helpful insights for developing swimming microrobots working in complicated environments. },

A highly conductive metallic gas that is quantum mechanically confined at a solid-state interface is an ideal platform to explore nontrivial electronic states that are otherwise inaccessible in bulk materials. Although two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) has been realized in conventional semiconductor interfaces, examples of two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG), which is the counter analogue of 2DEG, are still limited. Here, we report the observation of a 2DHG in solution-processed organic semiconductors in conjunction with an electric double-layer using ionic liquids. A molecularly flat single crystal of high mobility organic semiconductors serves as a defect-free interface that facilitates two-dimensional confinement of high-density holes. Remarkably low sheet resistance of 6 k\u03a9 and high hole gas density of 10 14  cm 14  result in a metal-insulator transition at ambient pressure. The measured degenerated holes in the organic semiconductors provide a broad opportunity to tailor low-dimensional electronic states using molecularly engineered heterointerfaces. },
