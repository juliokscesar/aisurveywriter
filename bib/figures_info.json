ior and polymer architecture, Langmuir monolayers with lipid compositions mimickingE.coli(POPE-POPG, 8:2 weight ratio) and S.aureus (POPG-CL, 6:4 weight ratio) were used for in- teraction studies at a surface pressure of\u224819 mN m\u22121 which wasthehighestsurfacepressurewherestablemonolayerscould be prepared.The lipid composition mimicking red blood cell (DOPC-DOPS(9:1weightratio))didnotpermitformationofthe prerequisite stable monolayer and was therefore not considered for Langmuir assays.Injecting polymer solutions (40\u03bcgm L\u22121) underneath the stabilized monolayers induced an increase in the surface pressure as depicted inFigure 5.L50 showed very comparableadsorptionkineticsandincreaseinsurfacepressure (\u2206\ud835\udf0b =4.8mNm \u22121 after1h)withbothPOPE-POPGandPOPG- CL monolayers.This suggests that the linear polymers interact similarlywithbothmonolayers,whichisduetotheirconforma- tional\ufb02exibility.In contrast, there were marked di\ufb00erences in the adsorp- tion of B50 to the two di\ufb00erent lipid mixtures.In case of the POPE-POPG monolayer, the pressure increased considerably (\u2206\ud835\udf0b =5.8mmm

    "description": "As can be seen from Figure 7A, the TRANES showed a prominent maxima at lower delay times (0\u22122.0 ns) in water.However, at higher delay times, the TRANES undergoes a red shift to \u223c540 nm, the region of excimer emission as assigned earlier.Similarly, the TRANES in the solid state undergoes a red shift to \u223c500 nm at higher delay times (Figure 7B).The above observations clearly point out the presence of aggregates (at lower delay times) as well as excimer (at higher delay times) in the emission spectrum, which could not be discerned in the steady-state emission spectrum owing to the large difference between the emission lifetime of the aggregate, J or H, with that of excimer.In addition, the clear difference in the TRANES maxima in water and solid state was indicative of the fact that the aggregates formed in water are essentially J-type, whereas those in solid are H-type.The TRANES for the LB films could not be successfully recorded owing to strong scattering from the SA fragments in the films while acquiring the data.At this stage, a thorough discussion was possible to explain the differing emitting species in Py-CHO and their variation upon change in phases (solution in water, solid, and LB films).Discussion on the Differential Nature of Interplay between Aggregates and Excimer.Since the coexistence of aggregate and excimer emission makes the excited-state photophysics of Py-CHO quite complex, a discussion is also presented.The interpretations followed the order THF, water, solid-state, and Py-CHO/SA LB films.In THF, the Py-CHO molecules simply behave as the classic pyrene molecule, with its excited-state photodynamics entirely guided by the monomer \u2194 excimer photoequilibrium.The lifetime values of the excimer and monomer were assigned from the TCSPC experiments.In water, the Py-CHO molecules form aggregates (as evidenced from the spectrodynamic experiments) as well as excimers alongside monomers.The nature of aggregates formed was assigned to be J-type, due to their longer emission lifetime compared to the monomers.The reason for preferential stabilization of J aggregates could be twofold: (i) opposing effects of poor stabilization of Py-CHO particles in pure aqueous medium and hydrogen-bonding stabilization of the \u2212CHO group by water molecules and (ii) preferential stabilization of J aggregates owing to dipolar stabilization of the same by the polar water molecules.The assumptions are fortified by the existing experimental and computational reports on preferential stabilization of J aggregates in pyrene, perylene, and porphyrin derivatives.57\u221260 In the solid state, the excited-state photophysics is dominated by monomers, excimers, and H aggregates, as observed from the excited-state lifetime measurements.The reason for this assignment was based on the assumption of parallel stacking of the Py-CHO molecules, facilitating extended nonclassical CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions in the solid state.Such an arrangement could be preferred over the J-type arrangement due to lack of external dipolar stabilization of the \u2212CHO group as in the case of water.Such stabilization has been observed previously for conjugated pyrene derivatives in the solid state.9,61,62 In the Py-CHO/SA LB films, the situation is more interesting owing to the presence of SA molecules.Since SA- based LB films are typically composed of a reticular framework, the Py-CHO molecules are \u201ctrapped\u201d in the matrix in various The excitation source and delay time are mentioned in the inset.Langmuir"

the first layer [pale blue region in Figs.8(b) and 8(d)] and the second layer [pale red region in Figs.8(b) and 8(d)] arrange themselves with \u201chead-to-head\u201d ion orientation at their shared boundary, because the effective number density of the anion decreases from n =4 to 8.Both the [C nmim]+ cation and [TFSA] \u2212 anion in the first layer are polar oriented such that the nonpolar groups (the alkyl chain and CF 3 group) point toward the CCl4 phase, while the polar groups (the imidazolium ring and SO2 group) face the RTIL phase.This orientation enables the CCl4 molecules to solvate the alkyl chains of the [C nmim]+ cations and the CF3 groups of the [TFSA]\u2212 anions.A.Solvation effect on the [Cn mim]+ cation at the CCl4/RTIL interface The number of gauche defects in the octyl chain of the [C8mim]+ cation is lower at the CCl4 interface than at the air inter- face [Figs.8(b) and 8(d)].This is in contrast with the case of the Langmuir film on the water surface, which has more gauche defects at the CCl4 interface than at the air interface,30\u201333 indicating that the solvation effect of CCl4 on the RTIL surface differs from that on the Langmuir film.The alkyl chain conformation at the interface can be simply discussed in terms of the free energy:F =U \u2212TS.61 The pres- ence of gauche defects in the alkyl chain increases the entropy, S, of the alkyl chain, which results in a decrease in the free energy, F.61 At the liquid/liquid interface, solvation (mixing) by the contacting liquid molecules increases the entropy term of mixing, Smix.The higher number of gauche defects in the Langmuir film at the CCl 4 interface than at the air interface 30\u201333 indicates that the J.Chem.Phys.162, 014705 (2025);

    "description": "FIG.8 Schematic structural models of the (a) air/[C 4mim][TFSA], (b) air/[C8mim][TFSA], (c) CCl 4/[C4mim] [TFSA], and (d) CCl 4/[C8mim][TFSA] interfaces.The pale blue and red regions in (b) and (d) represent the first and second layers, respectively.These layers are arranged in a \u201chead-to-head\u201d ion orientation at their shared bound- ary, which constitutes the bi-layering structure.alkyl chains are less solvated by CCl 4, lowering Smix, which reflects the solvophobic effect.31 By contrast, the lower number of gauche defects in the alkyl chains of the cations at the CCl4/[C8mim][TFSA] interface than at the air/[C8mim][TFSA] interface indicates that the alkyl chains are well solvated by CCl4, increasing Smix, which reflects the solvophilic effect.The surface number density of the alkyl chain at the [C 8mim][TFSA] surface (1.53 \u00d71014 cm\u22122)36 is much lower than that of the Langmuir film on water (3.6 \u00d7 1014 cm\u22122).30,31 Therefore, the loosely packed octyl chains at the [C 8mim][TFSA] surface reduce the number of gauche defects in their conformation at the CCl4 interface, being well solvated by CCl4 and yielding a high Smix value.This scenario is in contrast with that of the dense alkyl chains of the Langmuir film.The term of internal energyU, which is dominated by the interaction between the ions and CCl 4, including the Madelung energy as a long-range electrostatic interaction, also contributes to the structural formation at the RTIL/CCl 4 interface.The theoretical treatment of the internal energy U at the interface is under consideration and will be presented in the near future.B.Solvation effect on the [TFSA]\u2212 anion at the CCl4/RTIL interface The orientation of the [TFSA]\u2212 anion at the CCl4 interface dif- fers from that at the air interface, as shown in Fig.8.The SO2 groups of the [TFSA]\u2212 anion face toward the RTIL phase at the CCl4 and air interfaces, but the S\u2013S vector is nearly parallel to the CCl 4 interface and is tilted away from the air interface.This indicates that the area occupied by the [TFSA] \u2212 anion is larger at the CCl 4 interface than that at the air interface, which is in good agreement with the smaller interface number density of the cation at the CCl 4 interface than at the air interface.Such an orientational change of the [TFSA]\u2212 anion at the CCl4 interface may be due to the solvation effect of CCl4 on the [TFSA]\u2212 anion and/or on the alkyl chains of the [Cnmim]+ cation.The area occupied by CCl 4 is estimated to be 32 \u00c5 2 based on the van der Waals volume and is smaller than that of the [TFSA] \u2212 anion (39 \u00c52) at the CCl4 interface, as shown in Figs.7(a) and 7(b).This indicates that the alkyl chains of the cations are well solvated by CCl4 as compared to those at the air interface, where the occupation area of the [TFSA]\u2212anion is 26 \u00c52, as shown in Fig.7(c).In addition, the nearly identical peak positions of the CF 3-ss and SO2-ss modes of the [TFSA]\u2212 anion at the CCl4 and air interfaces indicate that the interaction of the [TFSA]\u2212 anion with CCl4 is negligible.Hence, the orientational change of the [TFSA]\u2212 anion to increase its area at the CCl4 interface is accompanied by the solvophilic effect of CCl 4 on the alkyl chains of the [C nmim]+ cation, which expands the space among the [Cnmim]+ cations.The MD simulation study on the spatial distribution of the anion around the cation in the bulk RTIL reveals the diffuse sol- vation shell of the [TFSA] \u2212 anion around the imidazolium ring of the [C 4mim]+ cation.62,63 This is caused by the weak basicity and acidity of the anion and cation, respectively, allowing for a flexible anion\u2013cation arrangement.62,63 The flexibility enables the orienta- tional change of the [TFSA]\u2212 anion accompanied by the solvophilic effect of CCl 4 on the alkyl chains of the [C nmim]+ cations.Con- sequently, the solvophilic effect of CCl 4 at the CCl 4/RTIL interface originates from the loosely packed alkyl chains of the cation at the RTIL surface, along with the flexible anion\u2013cation arrangement with the weak basicity and acidity of the ions of the RTILs.This differs from the solvophobic effect 31 of CCl4 on the dense alkyl chains of the Langmuir film with a rather rigid molecular arrangement owing to the strong basicity and acidity of the headgroup and counter ion of the ionic surfactant.30\u201333 VI.CONCLUSION We conducted an IV-SFG vibrational spectroscopic analysis to determine the microscopic structure at the CCl 4/[Cnmim][TFSA] (n = 4 and 8) interface and compared it with the structure at the air/[Cnmim][TFSA] interface.A quantitative analysis of the SFG spectra in the C\u2013H stretch region revealed the [C nmim]+ cation conformation/orientation at the CCl 4 interfaces as follows.(i) The terminal CH3 group of the alkyl chain of the [Cnmim]+ cation inter- acts with the CCl 4 phase.(ii) The interface number densities of the [C nmim]+ cation at the CCl 4 interface for alkyl chain lengths n = 4 and 8 are similar but lower than that at the air interface.J.Chem.Phys.162, 014705 (2025); doi: 10.1063/5.0237698 162, 014705-9 Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing 05 February 2025 19:05:37"

    "description": "B).This method was chosen over the Langmuir Blodgett deposition technique, as movement of the substrate from the subphase into the air- phase could cause the NP film to vertically pass through the magnetic field of the Langmuir trough.This would cause the NPs in the deposited film to move, and therefore result in the structure of the deposited film being different from that formed on the water surface.The drainage deposition method does not require the substrate to move upwards through the magnetic field, therefore resulting in less change in the NP film and gives better information about structure of the monolayer on the water surface.Briefly, the NP films were deposited from the water surface to 1 \u00d7 1 cm 2 glass substrates (S1111, Matsunami Glass Ind., Ltd., Japan) by draining the water.Briefly, the glass substrate was cleaned with a commercially available detergent (SCAT20X-PF, Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Japan).The glass substrate was then placed on spacers, which were positioned in the center of the trough where the variation in magnetic flux density was the smallest (dotted circles in Figs.1-2 ).The films were prepared in the way described above and compressed to the desired surface pressure.Once the surface pressure stabilized, the subphase water was removed by suctioning until the glass substate was higher than the water surface.The deposited NP film was then dried in air.3 O 4 NPs at air-water interfaces in the absence and presence of a magnetic field.Table 1 The concentrations of the NPs spreading solution ( C NP ) and the volume ( V spread ) used to prepare the NP films at the air-water interface.The number of NPs spread on the water surface ( N spread ) was calculated using C NP and V spread.C NP (mg/mL) C NP (NP/L) V spread (L) N spread 1.26 8.90 \u00d7 10 16 9.45 \u00d7 10 \u0000 4 8.41 \u00d7 10 13 4.50 3.18 \u00d7 10 17 2.65 \u00d7 10 \u0000 4 8.43 \u00d7 10 13 9.02 6.37 \u00d7 10 17 1.32 \u00d7 10 \u0000 4 8.41 \u00d7 10 13 2 AFM height images of the NP films deposited on glass sub - strates in the absence of a magnet (A, B, C), and in the presence of ferrite magnets (D, E, F) or neodymium magnets (G, H, I).The NP films were made using C NP = 6.37 \u00d7 10 17 NP/L (A, D, G), 3.18 \u00d7 10 17 NP/L (B, E, H), or 8.90 \u00d7 10 16 NP/L (C, F, I).The white lines show the position where the height profiles of Fig.5 were determined.C.E.McNamee et al"

    "description": "One single layer is generally transferred with the LS technique, but multilayers can be formed by repeating the touching and lifting procedure.147 A combination of LB and LS methods has been used to assemble supported lipid bilayers (SLB) as an alternative to direct deposition of liposomes onto solid supports; these bilayers are used as archetypes for cell membranes.148\u2212150 4.LANGMUIR MONOLAYERS IN MIMICKING CELL MEMBRANES An uprise in the interest in Langmuir monolayers occurred with their use as models for cell membranes.Understanding the structure and physicochemical properties of biomembranes is not straightforward, and much of the knowledge we have today has been achieved with the continuous development of model systems that mimic cell membranes.These membranes are highly complex, not only in terms of composition but also because of interweaved ordered or disordered structures.They are supramolecular assemblies whose molecular entities determine the organization at both macro- and molecular scales.The pioneering work by Singer and Nicolson151 described a cell membrane as a\u201cmosaic \ufb02uid\u201d, i.e., two lipid bilayers interconnected by interactions between their lipid alkyl chains, permitting their polar heads to be exposed to the external and internal side of the cell.The\ufb02uidity mentioned suggests that the lipids can move laterally inside their monolayer sheath, and some lipids can slowly migrate between the two bilayer sheaths in the so-called\u201c\ufb02ip-\ufb02op\u201d movement.The mosaic \ufb02uid model was updated a few years ago.152 Cell membranes contain lipids, proteins, and sugars to maintain the dynamic equilibrium and allow for di\ufb00erent cell functions, such as the permeation of components into or out of the cell and molecular recognition processes.Because Langmuir mono- layers can mimic only half a membrane, they are not suitable to investigate transport across the membrane.Hence, other models can be used as complementary, including liposomes, micelles, \ufb02at bilayers, and black lipid membranes.These arti\ufb01cially built models vary in the ability to control molecular composition, organization, curvature, and electrochemical gradient.Langmuir monolayers, in particular, are advantageous to control composition and surface packing.Whether these monolayers can mimic the membranes, which are at least bilayers, has been debated for many years regarding the relationship between monolayers and bilayers.153\u2212160 Although bilayers cannot exert surface pressure because they are closed systems, we can describe an internal lateral pressure based on the intermolecular forces between the lipid constituents, estimating a monolayer\u2212bilayer equivalence pressure of 30\u2212 35 mN/m.153,160 Langmuir monolayers can mimic various types of biological surfaces, including the cytoplasmatic membrane, the mitochon- drial membrane, the vesicular matrix, and virus envelopes.An interesting case is related to pulmonary alveolar membranes since a pulmonary surfactant forms a monolayer that reduces surface tension during breathing.161,162 The lung surfactant composition comprises 40% DPPC,\u223c40% other phospholipids (PG, other PC),\u223c10% surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D), and \u223c10% neutral lipids (cholesterol).163 DPPC can reduce surface tension to values close to zero, which can be understood by analyzing its surface pressure\u2212area isotherms: as a saturated lipid, it reaches the collapse at surface pressures close to 70 mN/m.This fact is important because the alveolar membrane must compress and expand rapidly during exhalation and inhalation, which occurs due to the membrane\u2019s interface onto solid supports (substrates).Chemical Reviews"

    "description": "Liquid\u2013liquid interfacial assembled 2D protein monolayer nanosheet based culture system for hMSC fate controlling.(A) A photograph and illustrations present the formation of a protein monolayer at the liquid\u2013liquid interface, resulting from the denaturation and self-assembly of serum proteins.The response of hMSCs to the sti\ufb00ness of the protein monolayer is clari\ufb01ed through the actin\u2013integrin\u2013\ufb01bronectin (FN) clutch mechanism.(B) Lysozyme monolayers, self-assembled at the liquid interface, are shown to maintain the self-renewal and multipotency of hMSCs.The lysozyme forms a close-packed monolayer through hydrophobic interactions amongb-sheet-rich oligomers.Enhancing the retention of multipotency by reducing cytoskeletal tension and glycolysis activity was veri\ufb01ed.The\ufb01gure also labels key glycolytic intermediates: fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6BP).(C) The adaptive self-assembled protein monolayer is responsive to the traction forces produced by cells, which in turn guides the di\ufb00erentiation of hMSCs.(D) The\ufb01gure illustrates the neuronal di\ufb00erentiation of hMSCs at the interface, where a 2D network of protein nano\ufb01brils is assembled.This di\ufb00erentiation process is related to lipid raft assembly and the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK).Reprinted with permission from ref.123 Copyright 2019 Wiley-VCH, ref.124 Copyright 2023 Wiley-VCH, and ref.125 Copyright 2019 Wiley-VCH.Reproduced under terms of the CC-BY license from ref.126, 2022 Springer-Nature.18742 | Chem.Sci.,2 0 2 4 ,15,1 8 7 1 5\u201318750 \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry Chemical Science Review Open Access Article.Published on 28 October 2024.Downloaded on 12/1/2024 12:51:41 PM.This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported Licence.View Article Online"
