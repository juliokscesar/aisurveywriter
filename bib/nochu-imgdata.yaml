    sections depict the "Deposition Au Nanoparticles," "Calcination and Chemical Etching,"

    7), each with varying arrangements of AuNPs. A scale bar of 500 nm is shown on
    each image.


    The diagram continues with "Immobilization of p-NA," "Immobilization of BSA,"
    and "Injection of Melamine," showing how the chip surface is functionalized to
    detect melamine. An absorbance spectrum displays the change in absorbance before

    The image presents nine 2D Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) height images, arranged
    in a 3x3 grid. Each image shows the surface topography of nanoparticle (NP) films
    deposited on glass substrates. The color scale on the right indicates height,
    ranging from 0 nm (dark brown) to 50 nm (light yellow).


    The columns represent different magnetic field conditions: "No magnet," "Ferrite,"
    and "Neodymium," indicating the absence of a magnetic field or the presence of
    a magnetic field generated by ferrite or neodymium magnets, respectively. The
    rows represent different nanoparticle concentrations (NP/L): 6.37 x 10^17, 3.18
    x 10^17, and 8.90 x 10^16.


    At the highest concentration (6.37 x 10^17 NP/L) without a magnet (A), the NPs
    form elongated, interconnected domains. With a ferrite magnet (D), the domains
    become more circular and distinct. With a neodymium magnet (G), the domains are
    even smaller and more uniformly distributed.


    At the intermediate concentration (3.18 x 10^17 NP/L), similar trends are observed:
    larger, connected domains without a magnet (B), smaller domains with ferrite (E),
    and even smaller, more dispersed domains with neodymium (H).


    At the lowest concentration (8.90 x 10^16 NP/L), the surface appears relatively
    smooth and uniform in all three magnetic field conditions (C, F, I), with only
    subtle variations in texture. A scale bar of 500 nm is visible in image A. White

    layer. The second step depicts the conversion of benzoquinone to hydroquinone,
    involving the uptake of protons and electrons. This process introduces "holes"
    into the PBTIT layer which is represented on a lower level by a layered structure
    of molecules with zigzag appendices.


    In the final step, the hydroquinone is formed, and the TFSI- anions are incorporated
    into the PBTIT layer, filling the "holes" created during the redox reaction. Chemical
    structures of PBTTT and TFSI- are shown in the center of the image. The layered

    The image is a composite figure illustrating a liquid-liquid interfacial culture
    system for human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and their fate control. It''s
    divided into four sections (A, B, C, D), each depicting a different aspect of
    the system.


    Section A shows a cell culture at a fluid interface between a medium and perfluorocarbon
    (PFC). It illustrates the formation of a protein monolayer through interfacial
    assembly and the seeding of hMSCs. A close-up depicts the molecular clutch mechanism,
    showing how cells interact with the protein nanosheet at the fluid interface.


    Section B focuses on an adaptive liquid interface for self-renewal. It shows lysozyme
    molecules adsorbing, unfolding, and forming beta-sheet oligomers at the interface.
    An inset highlights the FAK signaling pathway, involving proteins like Rho-GTP,
    ROCK, and PFK, leading to changes in glycolysis and stem cell fate.


    Section C illustrates cell traction forces exerted by hMSCs at the liquid-liquid
    interface, leading to hierarchical fiber structure formation through interfacial
    jamming and ultimately resulting in neuronal differentiation.


    Section D depicts a liquid-liquid interfacial culture system, showing hMSCs in
    culture. An inset zooms in on the hMSCs and details the molecular mechanisms involving
    GTPase, FAK, and contractile stress, ultimately leading to neuronal differentiation.

    nanocomposites and their Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films. It is divided into two

    Section (A) illustrates the synthesis of the nanocomposites. Starting with O-g-C3N4,

    and TAPP molecules are added to the O-g-C3N4NH2, resulting in the formation of
    O-g-C3N4@(Pd-TAPP)3.


    Section (B) depicts the LB film formation process. The O-g-C3N4@(Pd-TAPP)3 nanocomposites
    are dispersed in an LB trough containing EDTA molecules. A magnified view shows
    the hydrogen bonding interaction between TAPP and EDTA, forming a "bridge". Finally,
