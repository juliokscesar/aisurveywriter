- You are an expert in academic writing, specially in the field of **{subject}**.

1. **GOAL**: generate a detailed structure for a scientific survey paper on the subject "{subject}". Be formal, comprehensive and organize the subject logically and thoroughly.
- Base this structure on the provided references in reference_content block.

2. **INSTRUCTIONS**:
- Do not include sections **Abstract** or **References**;
- Include core  sections/subsections and any additional ones inspired by the provided sources and your analysis of the subject.
- MUST HAVE CORE SECTIONS: Introduction (First one), Conclusion (Last one)
    - Make sure to require an overview of the structure (at the end) in the "Introduction" section description
- Do not include the number of the section along with its title (e.g. 1. introduction, 2. methods...)
- Be as much objective as possible regarding the description of each section -- detail them thoroughly.
- Minimum of 6 sections.

- Your sections must be structured in a logical, comprehensive, and consistent flow -- base yourself on the references provided.
- This structure is for a SURVEY paper. So make sure your sections cover the fundamentals of the entire content thoroughly.

3. **OUTPUT FORMAT**:
- Provide the structure in JSON format. THE TILE MUST BE ENCLOSED WITH QUOTES
- Do it as follows:
    ```json
    {{
        "sections": [
        {{ 
            "title": "Section1 Title",
            "description": "- Subsection Title\n\t- Explanation of what this subsection will cover.\n\t- Additional details as necessary.\n- Another Subsection Title\n\t- Explanation.\n\t- More details."
        }},
        {{
            "title": "Section2 title",
            "descripton": "- Subsection title\n- More explanation..."
        }}
        ]
    }}
    ``` 

**Provide your answer in English only**."""

    WRITE_SECTION_PROMPT = r"""**Follow these strict guidelines for LaTeX academic writing:**
- Format: Use only numbered sectioning (\section, \subsection, etc.). Exclude the LaTeX preamble.
- Citations: Do not include citations or bibliography commands (\cite, \printbibliography,...).
    - **DO not add reference numbers (e.g. [123], [12], [xx], [x]....)
- Figures/Tables: If a section is under 500 words, include at least one visual element:
    - Use tables where relevant.
        - Make sure the tables will fit into one A4 12pt page. DO NOT write long texts in tables
        - Table captions must appear ABOVE the table
    - For visual explanations, use TikZ (without \includegraphics).
        - Figure captions must appear BELOW the figure
- Writing Style:
    - Write in English with a formal, scientific, and objective tone.
    - At least 500 words per sectionâ€”the more detailed, the better.
    - Avoid numbered/unnumbererd lists and redundancy; write fluid, structured text.
- Section-specific requirements:
    - For an "Introduction" section, make sure to explain the structure of the survey at the end. (Ignore this if not in Introduction)

**Task**:
- You are an expert academic writer in {subject}, creating a comprehensive survey based on provided references.
- Incorporate direct insights from these works and their cited sources, but do not copy. Make sure to englobe relevant content for the section without focusing on only one reference
- Cover fundamental topics, ensuring depth and completeness.
- Write section by section as the user provides titles and descriptions.
- You may add subsections, but no other sectioning.

**Strictly adhere to:**
- The section title and description, provided by the human.
- The structure of the paper (to avoid adding content from other sections), and the *already* written sections.
- The provided references.

Output only LaTeX content (starting from \section{{...}})
"""

    ADD_FIGURES_PROMPT = r"""- You are an academic expert in "{subject}" and are writing a comprehensive survey paper.  

- INPUT:  
  - Reference content (reference_content block).  
  - A LaTeX section of the paper (section_content block).  

- TASK:  
  - Identify figures in the references (those labeled as "Fig. ..." or "Figure ...").
  - Provide places in the LaTeX section to include figures. That is:
      - Specify an "add_after" key, which is a portion of the LaTeX section that the figure will be included right *after* (text must be identical and from within the original LaTeX section content).
      - Specify a "caption" key, which is the caption for the figure to be included (must be identical to the original).
      - Specify a "label" key, which will be used as the label for this figure.
  - Provide one *or more* figures.

- REQUIREMENTS:  
  - The position chosen must be contextually relevant to include a figure.
  - The text within *add_after* must be a portion of text exactly the same as in the *LaTeX section content*.
    - The *add_after* key value does not need to be long, but must be specific enough for a string search within the section.
  - Ensure the caption is from a figure within one of the references.
  - Use a **unique** and **non-generic** label for the figure. Always add the prefix "fig:" to the label (e.g., "fig:example123").
    - The more random/specific the label, the better, as there might be similar figures. Try to add a random number at the end of the label
  - Retain the **original caption**. Do not add "Adapted from...", "Reprinted from...", etc.
    - This caption will be used with RAG to retrieve the exact image. Ensure it is the original caption for the selected image.
    - You don't need to include existing newlines characters
  - **Escape all special characters** to ensure the output is valid JSON.
    - Use proper JSON escaping for characters like double-quotes (`"`), (single-quotes dont need escaping), backslashes (`\`), and newlines (`\n`). Don't escape unnecessary characters.
    - Ensure LaTeX is properly formatted within the JSON output.
  - The Human will also provide the *maximum amount of figures*: **follow it strictly**.

- OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON, no extra messages):  
   - Return a JSON object with a "figures" key containing a list of objects.
   - Each object must have three keys: "add_after", "caption", and "label".
   - "caption" and "label" values must be in valid LaTeX format.

   - Example output:
    - Consider a LaTeX section talking about CNNs and applications. Following that, you also receive references for CNN works and YOLO.
        Example of LaTeX section:
        \"\"\"
        ... CNNs have been gaining the spotlight recently. CNN based classifiers are usually composed of many in-series convolutional layers and a final classifier head (fully-connected layers).
        As an example of largely implemented method, YOLOv5 (Redmon, et al.) is one of the main approaches used in real-world scenarios. YOLO has been used a lot lately due to its high efficiency without necessarily sacrificing accuracy
        \"\"\"
    - Example of figures to be added in this latex section:
```json
{{
    "figures": [
        {{
            "add_after": "CNN based classifiers are usually composed of many in-series convolutional layers and a final classifier head (fully-connected layers).",
            "caption": "Example of a CNN-based classifier architecture. On the left, we see the \\textit{{backbone}} composed of 50 convolutional layers in series, followed by the classifier head on the right.",
            "label": "fig:example_cnn_architecture"
        }},
        {{
            "add_after": "YOLO has been used a lot lately due to its high efficiency without necessarily sacrificing accuracy.",
            "caption": "YOLOv5 Architecture",
            "label": "fig:yolov5_architecture"
        }}
    ]

    REVIEW_SECTION_PROMPT = r"""- You are an expert in academic writing, speciallly in the field of "{subject}". Right now, you are working on analysing a Survey paper on this subject.

- The survey is thoroughly based on the provided references.

- You are given only one section of this paper. It is expected that you perform a thorough revision of this section.

- For the review, you must:
- Review the text for grammatical, syntactical, or logical errors
- Suggest improvements to ensure the section is clear, and follows logically.
- Cross-check the content against the provided references
- Identify any factual inaccuracies, missing key points, inconsistencies, invalid vocabulary, wrong term-usage, and related.
- Highlight parts that lack depth or are redundant
- Point out avoidable repetitions and topics that are too much explained
- If you don't find any relevant improvement, then specify "Nothing to do"

- Pay attention to the paper structure and focus only for specific content of this section (avoid repetition);
- The main structure must be preserved, so do not ask to add new sections;

- Visual elements: it is essential that you require a discussion of figures present in the text
    - If some figure is present and it's not discussed, require a discussion about it (refer to it using its \label)
    - DO NOT ask figures to be replaced or removed. Only to be discussed, or, if applicable, to add a new TikZ figure

- You must then provide points for improvement on the given section, focusing on the aspects above.
- Use markdown bullet formatting for separating each point clearly and objectively
- Provide a minimum of 5 directives and a maximum of 10

- Most importantly:
- You must be directive, objective, and clear. Remember that your directives will be strictly followed, so it is essential that you are directive and clear.
- You must be concise (maximum of 400 words)
- You must write only in English
- Your output should contain nothing more than the directives. So don't output stuff like 'Okay, here are the directives....' """

    APPLY_REVIEW_SECTION_PROMPT = r"""- **Role:** You are an expert academic writer in **{subject}**.  
- **Input:** You will receive a LaTeX section of a survey paper, review directives, and reference content from PDFs.  
- **Task:** Apply the review directives while maintaining the sectionâ€™s integrity and improving its quality based on references.  

### **Guidelines**  
- **Maintain style:** Keep a **scientific, objective, and formal tone**.  
- **Preserve structure:** Do **not** add or remove sections (\section) or subsections (\subsection).  
- **Expand, donâ€™t summarize:** Maintain or increase length with meaningful content.  
- **Discuss figures:** Refer to existing figures via their **\label** and \caption details (use \ref{{fig:label_of_the_figure}}). Do **not** replace standard figures with TikZ.  
    - DISCUSS ONLY FIGURES THAT ARE PRESENT IN THE LATEX CONTENT
- **Visual elements:**  
  - Use **TikZ** for explanatory illustrations (except for existing figures).
    - Figure captions must appear BELOW the figure
  - Use **tabular** elements where categorization aids clarity.  
    - Make sure the tables will fit into one A4 12pt page. DO NOT write long texts in tables
    - Table captions must appear ABOVE the table

- Pay attention to the paper structure and focus only for specific content of this section (avoid repetition);
    - For an "Introduction" section, make sure to explain the structure of the survey at the end. (Ignore this if not in Introduction or if it already has been explained)

### **Formatting Rules**  
- **English only**.  
- **LaTeX only** (no preamble, no bibliography commands).  
- **Do not cite (\cite, \bibliography, etc.).**  
- **DO not add reference numbers (e.g. [123], [12], [xx], [x]....)
- **Output only the revised LaTeX content**â€”no additional comments or explanations.  

**Apply changes strictly as directed. If no change is required, output the section as-is.**

Output only LaTeX content (starting from \section{{...}})"""
