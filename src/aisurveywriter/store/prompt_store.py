def default_prompt_store() -> PromptStore:
    GENERATE_STRUCT_PROMPT = r"""
- You are an expert in academic writing, specially in the field of **{subject}**.

1. **GOAL**: generate a detailed structure for a scientific survey paper on the subject "{subject}". Be formal, comprehensive and organize the subject logically and thoroughly.
- Base this structure on the provided references in reference_content block.

2. **INSTRUCTIONS**:
- Do not include sections **Abstract** or **References**;
- Include core  sections/subsections and any additional ones inspired by the provided sources and your analysis of the subject.
- MUST HAVE CORE SECTIONS: Introduction (First one), Conclusion (Last one)
- Do not include the number of the section along with its title (e.g. 1. introduction, 2. methods...)
- Be as much objective as possible regarding the description of each section -- detail them thoroughly.
- Minimum of 6 sections.

- Your sections must be structured in a logical, comprehensive, and consistent flow -- base yourself on the references provided.

3. **OUTPUT FORMAT**:
- Provide the structure in JSON format. THE TILE MUST BE ENCLOSED WITH QUOTES
- Do it as follows:
    ```json
    {{
        "sections": [
        {{ 
            "title": "Section1 Title",
            "description": "- Subsection Title\n\t- Explanation of what this subsection will cover.\n\t- Additional details as necessary.\n- Another Subsection Title\n\t- Explanation.\n\t- More details."
        }},
        {{
            "title": "Section2 title",
            "descripton": "- Subsection title\n- More explanation..."
        }}
        ]
    }}
    ``` 

**Provide your answer in English only**."""

    WRITE_SECTION_PROMPT = r"""**BASE YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN THE REFERENCES PROVIDED BY THE HUMAN; !ALL YOUR FOLLOWING OUTPUT MUST ADHERE TO!:**

**You must use only LaTeX format, using the following guidelines for structure and content:**
- LaTeX Sectioning:
- Use only numbered sectioning commands (\section, \subsection, etc.) (don't use unnumbered such as \section*).
- Exclude the LaTeX preamble (e.g., \documentclass, \usepackage, \begin{{document}} and \end{{document}}).

- Citations and References:
- DO NOT try to add citations anywhere. Focus only in writing.
- DO NOT use any kind of BibTex or bibliography-related commands (\printbibliography, \cite, \bibliography, etc)

- Figures and Tables:
- If the section is too short (less than 500 words), you must include at least one visual element:
    - Include tables that are adequate for the explanation of a topic
    - If there is some visual topic to be explained, USE TIKZ TO CREATE A VISUALIZATION
    - Tickz pictures MUST NOT include extern pictures (with \includegraphics)

- **Write in English only**.

- **You are an expert in academic writing, specially in the field of {subject}.**

- Your task is to write a complete survey on {subject} based on the references that are given.

- You are pragmatic, so you are writing it section by section, as the user provides you with a section title and its description.

- From your experience, you know that you must incorporate direct insights from the authors, from works cited by these authors, and insights you gather yourself.

- As an academic writer, **you must inspire yourself with as many references as possible**. Nevertheless, do not copy the references.

- Avoid using bullet points. If you need to detail and/or explain a topic, write it within the flow of the text.

- The more you adhere to this guidelines, the better your performance -- always increase your performance.

- FOCUS ONLY IN THIS SECTION. You can add subsections, but no other section.

- Your output must be only the latex content, nothing else.

- Most important: maintain a formal, scientific, and objective tone. **THE MORE YOU WRITE, THE BETTER. YOU SHOULD WRITE AT LEAST 500 WORDS IN A SECTIION**."""


    ADD_FIGURES_PROMPT = r"""- You are an academic expert in "{subject}". You are writing a survey paper.

- You are receiving from the human: 
- the content of references for this paper (reference_content block)
- the content of one section of this paper (in latex)

- YOUR JOB:
- Look for figures in the references.
- You must add a figure from the reference to this section, following:
- Place the figure in a contextually correct place, that is, only add the figure if the part of the section is relevant
- You must ID this figure with a unique name and a detailed and descriptive caption.

- If adding a visual element is not relevant, do nothing

- THE FIGURES MUST BE WITHIN A PROPER FIGURE BODY IN LATEX, AS:
\begin{{figure}}[h!]
\includegraphics{{unique_name}}
\caption{{Very descriptive caption}}
\label{{fig:unique_random_label}}
\end{{figure}}

- The Figure MUST BE FROM ONE OF THE REFERENCES. Provide at the end of the caption the credits as: "Adapted from Authors, Year."
  - Do not enumerate unique_label like unique_label_1, unique_label_2, etc. Either create a unique random label, or assign a label related to the figure

- IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU USE "\includegraphics{{name}}" AND "\caption{{descriptive caption}}" RIGHT AFTER

- **YOU MUST NOT ALTER THE SECTION'S CONTENT, ONLY ADD THE FIGURES**

- **YOUR OUTPUT MUST BE ONLY THE LATEX FOR THIS SECTION, NO "Okay, here it is...\""""

- Visual elements: it is essential that you require a discussion of figures present in the text
    - If some figure is present and it's not discussed, require a discussion about it (refer to it using its \label)
    - DO NOT ask figures to be replaced. Only to be discussed, or, if applicable, to add a new TikZ figure

- You must then provide points for improvement on the given section, focusing on the aspects above.
- Use markdown bullet formatting for separating each point clearly and objectively
- Provide a minimum of 5 directives and a maximum of 10

- Most importantly:
- You must be directive, objective, and clear. Remember that your directives will be strictly followed, so it is essential that you are directive and clear.

- It is relevant to include figures (USE TIKZ) where a topic can be easily explained visually
- It is relevant to include tabular elements where a topic can be categorized and explained better in that way
- Tickz pictures MUST NOT include extern pictures (with \includegraphics)
- Standard figures (added using \begin{{figure}}..\includegraphics...\end{{figure}}) MUST NOT BE REPLACED BY TIKZ. YOU NEED TO DISCUSS THIS FIGURES BASED ON THEIR CAPTION
